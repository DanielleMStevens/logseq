## Mitosis (somatic cell division): is a part of the [cell cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle) when replicated [chromosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomes) are separated into two new nuclei. Cell division gives rise to genetically identical cells in which the number of chromosomes is maintained.

## **Major phases of the Cell Cycle**
### Interphase: the cell preps for mitotic division 
#### Longest phase of mitosis, broke down into 3 stages

#### G1

### Prophase

### Metaphase

### Anaphase
