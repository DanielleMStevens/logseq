- **Sec**
	- Sec export system main route of protein export across all of life
- **Tat**
	- specialized system exports proteins and protein complexes that must be folded or assembled in the cytoplasm
		- G+: TatAC
		- G-: TatABC
		- requires energy for exportation via proton motor force
	- in plant pathogens, TatC mutants have attenuated virulence + show pleiotropic effects
		- Pseudomonas syringae, Xanthamonas oryzae, Ralstonia, Agrobacterium
- **T1SS**
	- G+: rely on ABC transport machinery and membrane-fusion-proteins (MFPs)
	- G-: also has an outermembrane protein
	- ATP binding leads to conformational changes in transmembrane domain to be able to push unfolded peptides out
- **T2SS**
	- Found in G- bacteria, many times necessary for pathogenesis
		- secretes CAZymes
		- cargo must be folded to enter and get pushed out by the psuedopillus
