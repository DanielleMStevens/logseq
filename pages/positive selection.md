title: positive selection

## Positive selection is the process by which new advantageous genetic variants sweep a population. Though positive selection, also known as Darwinian selection, is the main mechanism that Darwin envisioned as giving rise to evolution, specific molecular genetic examples are very difficult to detect. Pioneering work by Yang and Nielsen has provided a much more powerful methodology for detecting positive selection at the sequence level.

## Though advantageous mutations are of great interest, they are difficult to detect and analyze because of the fact that neutral and deleterious mutations predominate them in frequency. Two major classes of methods are currently in use to detect positive selection: population methods, based on analyzing the nature and frequency of allele diversity within a species, and codon analysis methods, based on comparing patterns of synonymous and nonsynonymous changes in protein coding sequences.
