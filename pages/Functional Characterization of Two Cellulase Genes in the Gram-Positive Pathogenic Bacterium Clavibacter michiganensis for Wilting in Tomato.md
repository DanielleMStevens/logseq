## **Abstract**:
### details of the contribution of cellulases to the development of wilting in tomato have not been well-determine

### A [[celA]] mutant of the C. michiganensis type strain [[LMG7333]] lost its 
cellulase activity and almost all its ability to cause wilting in tomato.

### cellulase catalytic domain and cellulose-binding domain of [[celA]] together 
were sufficient for both cellulase activity and the development of wilting in tomato

### celA ortholog of [[Clavibacter sepedonicus]] restored the full virulence of the celA mutant of C. michiganensis

### [[celB]], located in the chromosome, carries a single-base deletion in most 
C. michiganensis strains but does not carry a functional signal peptide 
in its N terminus.

## **Introduction**:
### genome analyses of bacterial plant pathogens have revealed that 40% of them encode at least one cellulase gene (Medie et al. 2012).

### Cellulase-lacking mutant strains of both [[Xanthomonas]] oryzae pv. oryzae,  causing bacterial leaf blight in rice, and X. citri subsp. citri, causing citrus canker, showed attenuated virulence in the host plants

### Two cellulase genes from [[Xanthomonas campestris]] pv. campestris play a role in early pathogenesis in turnip and radish plants

### endoglucanase encoded by egl of [[Ralstonia solanacearum]], which can break down [[cellulose]], is also important to pathogenesis in tomato plants

### The fungal rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae has two cellulase genes that play roles in its virulence

### he importance of both plasmids during infection was confirmed by virulence assays in tomato using strains that naturally lacked one or more plasmids or mutant strains in which one or both plasmids were removed

### A genome analysis of strain NCPPB382 revealed another cellulase gene, celB, on its chromosome [(Gartemann et al. 2008)]([[The Genome Sequence of the Tomato-Pathogenic Actinomycete Clavibacter michiganenesis subsp. michiganensis NCPPB 382 Reveals a Large Island Involved in Pathogenicity]])

### expression was up-regulated during infection of C. michiganensis and [[Clavibacter sepedonicus]] in tomato and potato, respectively (Chalupowicz et al. 2010; Holtsmark et al. 2008)

### CelA carries an expansin domain (ED) as a third domain in its C-terminal region and a partial deletion of the ED domain may influence the virulence of C. michiganensis (Jahr et al. 2000).

## **Results**:
### **celA of the C. michiganensis type strain LMG7333 is required for wilting in tomato**:
#### 7 days after inoculation (dai), the celA:Tn mutant did not exhibit wilting (Fig. 1C), although it did cause very weak wilting at 14 dai.

#### the complementary strain celA:Tn(celA) fully recovered the ability to cause wilting in tomato.

### **The cellulase CD and CBD of CelA together are sufficient for virulence activity**:
#### The C. michiganensis strains, WT, celA:Tn, and celA:Tn carrying the full-length celA, the CD-CBD, the CD, the ED with signal peptide (SP), or green fluorescent protein gene (GFP) as a control were incubated with 0.4% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as a substrate.

#### All FLAG-tagged truncated forms of CelA were strongly expressed and present in both fractions

#### a celA:Tn strain carrying the ED fused with the N-terminal SP and a C-terminal FLAG tag (SP-ED) was generated. The SP-ED was well-expressed and well-secreted in comparison with the full-length CelA gene

**Fig. 2. Generation of the celA-truncated constructs and their expression in the celA:Tn mutant.** A, The domain structure of CelA and a schematic diagram of the deletion series of celA based on a cellulase catalytic domain (CD), a cellulose binding domain (CBD), and an expansin domain (ED) with signal peptide (SP). B, An immunoblot analysis using FLAG tag antibody (a-FLAG) to detect the FLAG-tagged CelA-truncated protein forms expressed in the celA:Tn mutant. The presence of each CelA-truncated protein form was separately determined in the supernatant and pellet after Clavibacter michiganensis growth in the medium. C, An immunoblot analysis of the FLAG-tagged CelA-ED with or without the SP in the celA:Tn mutant, using a FLAG-tag antibody (a-FLAG). The presence of the CelA expansin domain with the SP was determined in the supernatant after C. michiganensis growth in the medium. Total proteins were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) as a loading control.

#### C. michiganensis WT and celA:Tn and its complementary strains were  inoculated to tomato plants by the root dipping inoculation method.

#### Unlike a previous report showing that CelA lacking the intact ED failed to restore virulence in the pCM1-cured NCPPB382 strain

#### celA:Tn(CD-CBD) caused wilting similar to the WT strain

#### celA:Tn (CD) and celA:Tn(SP-ED) could not cause wilting comparable to the celA:Tn or celA:Tn(GFP) strains

#### these results suggest that the CD and CBD domains together are sufficient for the development of wilting symptoms in tomato and that the lack of a functional CelA does not affect bacterial growth substantially.

### **The cellulase activity of secreted CelA is tightly linked to wilting symptoms in tomato**:
#### a plate assay using Congo red staining was performed.

#### the hydrolysis halos, which are the clear zones in which CMC is degraded
 by secreted cellulases, were visualized, measured, and compared with the sizes of the bacterial colonies

#### The WT strain had clear halos surrounding the bacteria, while no halos were observed around the celA:Tn strain (Fig. 4A and B).

#### celA:Tn strains complemented with the CD or the SP-ED, clear halos were extremely weak or undetectable

#### CD and CBD together are required and that the CD alone is not sufficient for efficient cellulase activity.

### **The celA and its ortholog in other Clavibacter species are functionally conserved**:
#### The presence of celA in [[Clavibacter capsici]] caused wilting in tomato, although its severity was lower than that caused by [[Clavibacter michiganensis]]

#### the CD-CBD domains together were sufficient for the development of wilting with [[Clavibacter capsici]] but the CD or SP-ED alone were not.

#### When [[celA]]Cs was expressed under its native promoter in the celA:Tn strain, this gene successfully led to severe wilting in tomato plants (Fig. 5D,E)

#### protein expression of celACs was slightly lower than that of celA in C. michiganensis

#### Although the [[celA]]Cs gene of [[Clavibacter sepedonicus]] is plasmid-borne and plays a role in virulence, almost no wilting symptoms were observed in tomato plants inoculated with C. sepedonicus.

#### sequence differences between celA and celACs and their promoters affect 
the inability of C. sepedonicus to cause disease symptoms in tomato plant

#### celA genes of C. michiganensis and C. sepedonicus under their native 
promoters and celACs driven by the promoter of C. michiganensis (PCm-celA) were transformed into C. sepedonicus 2137

#### Both strains failed to cause wilting in tomato plants, similarly to the wild-type strain 2137

#### [[Clavibacter sepedonicus]] requires additional virulence factors to cause disease in tomato

#### bacterium carries certain host-specificity factors to limit its [host range]([[Clavibacter host range]])

### **A single-base deletion in the chromosomally located celB gene of C. michiganensis truncates the protein**:
#### Unlike strain NCPPB382, [[celB]] of strain LMG7333 might encode a truncated protein due to a single nucleotide deletion 316 bp from the start of the gene (Fig. 6A; Supplementary Fig. S4)

#### the gene was cloned and sequenced from eight more strains of C. michiganensis.

#### All the celB genes, except that from strain [[NCPPB  382]], had a guanine deletion at position 316 bp, similar to strain LMG7333

#### [[Clavibacter capsici]] [[PF008]] [[celB]] resembles that from strain [[NCPPB  382]]

#### almost no cellulase activity in the celA:Tn strain was observed (Fig. 4) indicates that celB of strain [[LMG7333]] might not encode a functional cellulase.

### **The efficient secretion of C. michiganensis CelB contributes to wilting in tomato**:celB from C. michiganensis LMG7333, a guanine base was 
inserted at position 316 by site-directed mutagenesis, named as celB316g (Fig. 6A)
#### Neither of the two [[celB]] genes could restore cellulase activity (Fig. 6B)
 nor the ability to develop wilting in tomato (Fig. 6C and D).

#### ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FQualifying_Exam%2FkOOt_8Xh9B.png?alt=media&token=50695d0d-6d97-4ef5-a990-23141536f10a)

#### Therefore, the N-terminal region of the CelB protein was further analyzed to see if a functional SP was present.

#### SP of celA (SPcelA) to generate SPcelAcelB316gΔ30 under the control of the celA promoter PcelA (Fig. 7A).

#### These constructs were transformed into the celA:Tn strain and their protein secretion levels were determined. Notably, the 
SPcelA-celB316gD30 form was efficiently produced and secreted, while the original celB316g form was not

#### The SPcelA-celB316gD30-EDcelA form was also successfully secreted into the supernatant (Fig. 7B)

#### This strain also caused wilting in tomato (Fig. 7D and E), although wilting was delayed and mild compared with that seen with the WT strain.

## **Discussion**:
### Both [[Clavibacter sepedonicus]] (Laine et al. 2000) and [[Clavibacter insidiosus]] (accession number CP011044.1) carry a celA homolog in their plasmids (Lu et al. 2015)

### In particular, mutants with a partial deletion of the ED have cellulase activity but fail to recover pathogenesis. These previous results are inconsistent with our results.

### The role of the ED is speculative. It may loosen cell walls to allow cellulase enzymes better contact with cellulose fibers (Cosgrove 2017; Georgelis et al. 2014).

### Strain LMG7333 carries an expansin gene in its chromosome [(Tancos et al. 2017)]([[Plant-like bacterial expansins play contrasting roles in two tomato vascular pathogens]]), but there is no evidence that this gene contributes to disease development.
