- **Abstract**:
	- Clavibacter-like isolates from tomato seed are phenotypically similar to [[Clavibacter michiganensis]] in the common diagnostic semi-selective media and are identiﬁed as Cm in the customary tests but are not pathogenic to tomato
	- Tomato stems were not colonized nor was there evidence of survival in tomato stems
	- They belong to the Cm species but can be unambiguously separated from [[Clavibacter michiganensis]]
- **Introduction**:
	- Weakly virulent and avirulent [[Clavibacter sp.]] are also frequently isolated from tomato seeds
	- isolates of Clavibacter, speciﬁcally related to C. michiganensis, were 
	  reported on rice seed [10,11] and were recovered from healthy aerial 
	  tissues of prairie plants.

	- the latter were found to colonize the plant species from which they were isolated as endophytes without causing disease symptoms.
	- Homolog genes of the pat-1 gene, named phpA/B, are also present on the pCM2 plasmid but it was demonstrated that these genes are not involved in pathogenesis ([2]([[Identification of homologues to the pathogenicity factor Pat-1, a putative serine protease of Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis]]))
	- Knowledge of the extent and nature of the genetic diversity of pathogens in their natural habitats is essential for epidemiological studies but also for understanding the ecological and evolutionary forces that govern their distribution and population dynamics.
	- Atypical [[clavibacter]] strains lacking pat-1 gene and inducing weaker symptoms on 
	  tomato were found on symptomatic plants in greenhouses in Italy ([5]([[Clonal populations of Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis are responsible for the outbreaks of bacterial canker in greenhouse tomatos in Italy]]))
- **Results**:
	- **Pathogenicity, colonization tests and bacterial colony morphology**:
		- After 21 days of incubation the plants were checked for speciﬁc symptoms. None of the Clavibacter-like strains induced disease symptoms, whereas Cmm strains produced wilting or/and canker (Fig. 1; Table 1).

		- Among Cmm strains there were three strains that did not induce disease symptoms despite the presence of one or more virulence factors.
		- Strains isolated from tomato seeds were not able to colonize the plant. In addition, they could not be reisolated even after several days of post inoculation which suggests that they do not survive in plant tissues.
			- Their disability to invade in planta suggests that their genetic structure is lacking some important genes responsible for effective plant colonization.
		- Bacterial canker of tomato, caused by [[Clavibacter michiganensis]], is an example of a plant pathogenic bacterium that forms bioﬁlm on the host, as well as on production, processing, transportation and storage surfaces. Eradication of bioﬁlm from seeds and hard surfaces is a key management strategy for control of bacterial canker caused by Cmm.

	- **Taxonomic position of Clavibacter-like strains**:
		- Non-pathogenic Clavibacter-like strains differ in the gyrB gene sequence and can be separated from other Clavibacter subspecies on the phylogenetic tree of gyrB (Maximum Likelihood). BLAST search of the 16S rRNA gene sequences identiﬁed 20 strains as belonging to C. michiganensis species, ﬁve other strains were found to belong to other 
		  genera in the family Microbacteriaceae (Table 2).
		- At present the clariﬁcation of this complex taxonomic situation in the genus Clavibacter is investigated by
			- (i) including more isolates, 
			  (ii) host range determination and 
			  (iii) whole genome sequencing
	- **Molecular basis of pathogenicity**:
		- For Clavibacter only a few genetic factors, like pat-1 [15] or [[celA]] [27] were found to play a role in pathogenicity, furthermore their presence does not always correlate with the actual ability of bacteria to induce disease symptoms ([29]([[Characterization of a Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis population in Israel]]))
		- Within the Clavibacter-like group ampliﬁcation of [[tomA]] was detected in two out of eleven strains (LMG 26812 and LMG 26817).
		- Amplicons of [[ppaA]] gene were observed for four  strains and in three cases only a faint amplicon was visible
		- For [[chpC]] a positive ampliﬁcation was detected in LMG 26811 and LMG 26812. The fact that the majority of tested strains were negative for genes located on PAI might suggest that this region in the chromosome is missing.
		- Gartemann et al. showed that both plasmids, pCM1 and pCM2, carrying the virulence factors can be successfully transferred to recipients lacking one or both of them. These results from in planta experiments suggest that both plasmids are transmissible and probably contain the genes required for transport or mobilization functions ([21]([[Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis: first steps in the understanding of virulence of a Gram-positive phytopathogenic bacterium]]))
	- **Cellulase activity**:
		- Surprisingly, almost all these isolates besides ﬁve showed no cellulase activity whereas the Cmm strains tested appeared to have high cellulase activity with two strains, LMG 5616 and PD 5707, that produced noticeably larger ‘halo’ around their colonies (Table 1)
