## Focus on Biovar3 - vitus - limited host range

## assess distribuion of SNPs

## each strain - align reads back onto its own genome to select only protein in plasmid

## For picking reference to call SNPs against for each species/clades
### 1) species groups via Rhierbaps

### 2) pick best genome by quality stats
