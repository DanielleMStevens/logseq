## **Abstract**:

## **Introduction**:
### When fitness costs and benefits of symbioses are quantified, it becomes clear that there is inexactness in categorization and a continuum even between two symbiotic partner species

### Economic impact is not a selective pressure that directly shapes the evolution of symbiotic bacteria. Hence, it is critical to consider the natural variation and ecology of populations, which provide the context for natural selection, or lack thereof, to understand why and how organisms adapt.

## **Lifestyles of Gram-positive Plant-associated bacteria**:
### **Clavibacter: A Group of Xylem-Limited Bacteria**:
#### Some strains of C. michiganensis lacking pCM2 are still pathogenic on tomato, indicating that pCM2 is not always necessary for pathogenicity of C. michiganensis (125)

#### pCM-like plasmids in pathogenic strains isolated from field-grown plants differ considerably with respect to size and composition compared to those in NCPPB382 (125)

#### [[CAZymes]] involved in degrading cellulose (GH1, GH3) and hemicellulose (GH35) than other members of this genus (125)

#### revealed differences in cell wall chemistry with reduced arabinogalactan epitopes and loosening of xyloglucan epitopes, indicating severe modification of the integrity of the plant cell wall (125).

### **Streptomyces: Taxa of Root-Associated Bacteria**:
#### [[Streptomyces]]is a large and diverse genus with more than 800 named species. This group is best known for the production of secondary metabolites (129).

#### Some of the more commonly studied pathogenic species include Streptomyces scabiei (syn. Streptomyces scabies), Streptomyces turgidiscabiei, and Streptomyces acidiscabiei. Diseases of potato and other root crops caused by this group are prevalent, endemic, and costly because of the expression of raised or pitted lesions that make the tubers nonmarketable (15).

#### Nonpathogenic [[Streptomyces]] can also directly, via production of secondary metabolites, and indirectly, via triggering induced systemic resistance, suppress the growth of plant pathogens (105, 133).

#### [[thaxtomin A]] is the most important virulence molecule associated with plant-pathogenic lineages of Streptomyces (90). [[thaxtomin A]] is a phytotoxin, a chemical compound that compromises the normal development of plant cells.

#### The thaxtomin locus is located within a txt [[pathogenicity island]] (PAI) and some strains of Streptomyces modified to carry the txt PAI gain the ability to cause symptoms typical of common scab disease (18, 78, 90, 147).

#### CebE protein, characterized in S. scabiei, and are shepherded through the CebEFG-MsiK ABC transporter into the cytoplasm (73). Cellobiose and cellotriose then relieve CebR, the cellulose utilization repressor protein, from two binding sites in the thaxtomin biosynthetic cluster (49)

#### The mode of toxicity of thaxtomin is not well established. In potato, symptom development occurs only if the pathogen is present and producing thaxtomin during early tuber development (80). In Arabidopsis, thaxtomin causes severe stunting as well as hypertrophy and demonstrably inhibits cellulose synthesis (51, 115), although the inhibition of cellulose synthesis is potentially indirect

### **Rhodococcus: Root- and Leaf-Associated Bacteria**:
#### Phytopathogenic lineages of Rhodococcus are present in two of the clades. These bacteria cause proliferations of differentiated shoots called leafy galls or witches’ brooms (Figure 1) (107). 

#### Diseased tissues are hypothesized to be nutrient sinks that can be exploited by the pathogen (119). 

#### More than 100 plant taxa, including both monocots and dicots that have herbaceous and woody growth habits, can be infected by pathogenic Rhodococcus, and individual plant species can be host to diverse lineages of Rhodococcus (107, 113). 

#### Pathogenic Rhodococcus can be distinguished from nonpathogenic lineages by the unique presence of a cluster of three virulence loci. In the majority of sequenced pathogenic lineages, these virulence loci are harbored on a plasmid (33, 34). Strains cured of the plasmid are not pathogenic, mutants with insertions in the att locus have attenuated virulence, and those in which fasR and fas loci are disrupted are not pathogenic (33).

#### An important confounding factor that cannot be overlooked is that cytokinins have ancient origins and are present in bacteria and eukaryotes as modifications on base 37, 3′-adjacent to the anticodon, of a subset of tRNAs (116). In fact, several studies have associated the accumulation of cytokinin in Rhodococcus cultures with the degradation of tRNAs (93, 110, 114).

### **Rathayibacter: Hitchhiking to Grass Seedheads**:
#### Members of the Rathayibacter genus cause gumming disease of grasses (98). These bacteria are vectored by juvenile parasitic nematodes of the subfamily Anguininae and gain access to the ovaries of grasses (Figure 1).

#### The bacteria are hypothesized to require the nematode to first establish seed galls that they then inhabit, as Rathayibacter is not as capable of colonizing plant hosts when inoculated directly (111).

#### Rathayibacter may then outcompete the nematode to occupy the preestablished gall. The relatively low inventory of [[CAZymes]] may reflect the reliance of Rathayibacter on nematodes for plant colonization (Figure 2).

#### Grazing animals that consume grasses contaminated with R. toxicus can succumb to annual ryegrass toxicity, which is associated with often lethal neurological disorders. This toxicity is due to corynetoxin, a member of the tunicamycin family of nucleotide antibiotics that inhibit the first step of protein glycosylation in eukaryotes (106).

#### The bacteriophages appear to exist in multiple copies as independent replicons in a pseudolysogenic state, which is an extended, arrested, and nonreplicative developmental state (26, 100). Bacteria with such pseudolysogenic phages are also associated with the production of corynetoxin. However, ecological sampling of R. toxicus failed to correlate the presence of toxin with the presence of a phage (85).

### **Leifsonia: Xylem-Limited Bacteria**:
#### There are 11 species of [[Leifstonia]], with only two subspecies of Leifsonia xyli recognized as plant pathogens (47, 142). 

#### [[Leifstonia]] xyli subsp. xyli is the causal agent of ratoon stunting disease of sugarcane and contributes to significant economic losses worldwide (Figure 1) (128). L. xyli subsp. xyli adheres to the surface of scalariform xylem vessels and interferes with water transport, leading to the reduction of height and diameter of sugarcane (145). 

#### [[Leifstonia]] xyli subsp. cynodontis colonizes the xylem of Bermudagrass, causing Bermudagrass stunting disease (36). 

#### Given that these pathogens and those in the genus Curtobacterium are similar to Clavibacter species in having xylem-limited lifestyles, it was somewhat unexpected that the examined genome sequences had so few predicted [[CAZymes]](Figure 2). 

#### However, the decay in the genome of L. xyli subsp. xyli and the fastidious nature of this pathogen could also account for the lower number of predicted [[CAZymes]] (16). In many grasses, [[Leifstonia]] xyli subsp. cynodontis is an endophyte (97).

### **Curtobacterium: Xylem-Limited Bacteria**:
#### [[Curtobacterium]] flaccumfaciens is a seed-transmitted vascular pathogen causing bacterial wilt of common bean (Figure 1) (2). 

#### This disease is the most important bacterial disease of dry beans in the United States and is a quarantined pathogen in many countries (2). 

#### Like other groups of bacteria discussed in this review, the outcomes of the symbioses of members of Curtobacterium with plants are variable. 

#### Strains of [[Curtobacterium]] have been isolated as nonpathogenic endophytes, whereas pathogenic C. flaccumfaciens has been implicated as being beneficial to plant species other than bean (7, 21, 22, 127).

## **Do Gram-Positive Bacteria and Their Plant Hosts Zig and Zag?**
### A zigzag model has been developed that fits mechanisms of virulence and immunity into an evolutionary framework of an arms race between microbes and plants (69). Depending on the microbial elicitor, different sectors of the immune system can activate and elicit a response that varies in timing and amplitude.

### Pattern-triggered immunity is elicited upon the perception of features conserved in microbes. Many phytopathogenic organisms deploy so-called effector proteins to strike key immunity nodes, dampening responses below a threshold and rendering pattern-triggered immunity ineffective. 

### However, certain genotypes of host species encode proteins that perceive an [[effectors]] and can mount a rapid effector-triggered immune response. The latter immune response imposes a strong [[selective pressures]], leading to continual loss and gains of effector genes.

### [[Gram-positive bacteria]] cause changes in host plants indicative of an immune response (10, 11, 112). Their cell envelope includes various antigenic features conserved in bacteria, and peptidoglycan of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptomyces species, for example, can cause changes in Arabidopsis that are consistent with an immune response (48, 59). 

### [[Gram-positive bacteria]] also express Ef-Tu, characterized in Gram-negative bacteria as an elicitor of plant immunity, on their surfaces (138). 

### It is also the case that the composition of Gram-positive bacteria in microbiota associated with Arabidopsis mutants affected in immune signaling is significantly different relative to that of wild-type plants (87). 

### However, it is ^^unclear whether such differences reflect immunity acting directly on Gram-positive taxa or indirect consequences from changes in priority effects^^, which are the effects that the sequence in which species arrive have on community composition. 

### We are not aware of any demonstration that a purified conserved microbial feature ^^from a pathogenic member of Actinobacteria is sufficient as an elicitor^^

### Effector-triggered immunity has also not been demonstrated to confer resistance to [[Gram-positive bacteria]]. For [[clavibacter]], quantitative trait loci ([[QTL]]s) impacting the severity of disease symptoms have been mapped in wild tomato species (74). 

### Resistance does not appear to be due to classic immunity. For example, the ^^Rcm2.0^^ [[QTL]] overlaps with another QTL controlling an ^^increased rate of stem vascular development^^ and may affect the maturation of the vascular system (29, 74).

### Cultivars of potato resistant to [[Streptomyces]] are available for controlling common scab. But no dominant resistance genes have been identified and only a few putative resistance-associated [[QTL]]s have been discovered in Solanum germplasm (15). Resistance to scab is hypothesized to be due to morphological changes to the tuber. 

### For example, common scab-tolerant potatoes developed through somatic cell selection with [[thaxtomin A]] as the selectable marker uniformly have thicker periderms, potentially limiting the accessibility of the toxin and the pathogen into the tuber (139).

### Resistance to [[Curtobacterium]] flaccumfaciens is rare. The combined results from ^^two separate screens of more than 2,100 accessions yielded fewer than 40 accessions with reduced symptoms^^ (60). It is unknown whether these are conferred by dominant resistant genes or via [[QTL]]s.

### Thus, the ^^strength of plant immunity as a selective pressure on Gram-positive bacteria is unknown,^^ and there is little context for understanding the mechanisms hypothesized to contribute to their virulence.

## **What Other Evolutionary Processes Could Have Shaped Gram-Positive Bacteria?**

## **Disease Symptoms Caused by Gram-Positive Bacteria: Fitness Advantage or Collateral Damage?**
### A fundamental assumption is that [[Gram-positive pathogen]]s gain a fitness advantage at a cost to the host. But in the symbioses described here, the benefits reaped and costs exacted on the hosts have not all been sufficiently quantified.

### Of the bacterial taxa discussed here, [[clavibacter]] most easily meets the strict definition of a pathogen. Pathogenic [[clavibacter]] tend to have higher bacterial loads compared to endophytes. 

### [[Clavibacter michiganensis]] strains that experienced a spontaneous deletion of the entire chp/tomA PAI have significantly lower growth (55). But bacterial growth and virulence are not always positively correlated (99, 125). 

### It is also the case that the deletion of key genes encoding [[CAZymes]] or serine proteases or loss of plasmids that compromise that ability of the bacteria to cause disease symptoms does not lead to large decreases in bacterial titers (99, 125).

## **Discussion**:

## Other notes:
### Symbiosis: intimate and protracted interaction between different species with measurable costs and/or benefits to one or both partners.

### Mutualist: bacteria that directly invest (cost) in an interaction that benefits both partners.

### Associative symbionts: bacteria that interact with plants in a less specific manner than mutualists and reciprocate benefits to their partners.

### Pathogen: bacteria that gain from the interaction at a cost to the host; typically associated with disease.

### [[Horizontal Gene Transfer]] (HGT): transfer of genetic material through any mechanism other than vertical inheritance.

### Disease (infectious;strict definition): biotic-induced perturbation to homeostasis leading to degradation instructure or function and a fitness cost

### Virulence: the degree to which an organism can cause disease

### Endophytes: bacteria that do not cause disease and are present within the tissue of plants

### Virulence genes: nonessential genes that are necessary for a pathogenic organism to gain a fitness advantage at a cost to the host

### Pathogenicity: the ability of an organism to cause disease

### Carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes): enzymes that degrade, modify, or cleave glycosidic bonds

### Pathogenicity island (PAI): a large genetic element that encodes one or more genes necessary for pathogenicity and has been incorporated into the genome of a pathogenic bacterial lineage
