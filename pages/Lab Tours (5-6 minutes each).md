- Email announcement 10-22-2020:
	- Good evening everyone,
	- As we quickly move through the Fall quarter, soon the new year will be upon us and with that, comes IGG Recruitment. As you can guess, this year we will be implementing a virtual recruitment. Therefore, we need your help!
	- First, we recognize that we may need to think creatively on how to engage with future students and showcase how awesome our grad program is. Therefore, we would like to recruit a few students to help us make short videos (4 - 6 minutes) highlighting your lab and your work. These can be taken with a camera or even your phone. Our goal is since the recruits cannot be here, maybe we can at least show them what it's like being a grad student in IGG and the work that we do.
	- Second, we are hoping to have you join us for a happy hour hang out, virtual style. It will be on Friday, February 5th at 6 pm. The Zoom link + calendar invite will be sent out once we get closer to the new year. So set your calendars for that!
	- Please feel out this survey so we can get a sense of participation and for the happy hour, can plan activities around that.
	- We really need you to join us to help make this recruitment great! We know being at home is hard and honestly, I can't even imagine how hard it is try to apply for grad school right now. Let's try to play our part and make it a little easier decision for your future aggie colleugues (and friends)!
	- Thanks you and before you go back to your indox, fill out this survey!
	- Dani, JJ, Fiona, and Alba (IGG Recruitment Committee)
