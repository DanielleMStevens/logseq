- **Tags**: #[[plant cell wall structure]]
- **Introduction**:
	- The primary walls of plant cells are composed mainly of polysaccharides, 
	  but they also contain structural proteins and many different enzymes
	- Among the polysaccharides, cellulose is the most important and normally 
	  the most abundant. Cellulose ^^microfibrils are embedded in a matrix of 
	  other polysaccharides, glycoproteins and protein^^s
	- cellulose is made at the plasma membrane and deposited directly into the wall, while most ^^other matrix components are made in the Golgi^^ and ^^delivered ^^to the wall ^^in secretory vesicle^^s
- **Primary cell walls: composition and biosynthesis **:
	- **Cellulose**:
		- Because an exhaustive summary of the large body of literature relating to
		   cellulose and its biosynthesis is beyond the scope of this chapter, the 
		  reader is referred to excellent recent discussions on these 
		  topics (Doblinet al., 2002, 2003; Saxena and Brown, 2005).
		- Cellulose, ^^crystalline 1,4-β-d-glucan^^ is synthesized at the plant plasma membrane. In plants, cellulose ^^microfibrils are about 3 nm ^^in diameter and generally consist of ^^parallel arrangements of thirty-six 1,4-β-d-glucan chains^^

		- These complexes are visible as hexameric rosettes approximately 25–30 nm in diameter.
		- CESA proteins are large (∼1000 amino acids) integral membrane proteins with eight predicted transmembrane domains; they have all been classified as members of the CAZy family GT2 (Richmond, 2000; Coutinhoet al.,  2003).  The catalytic domain, containing D, DXD and QXXRW residues characteristic of processive β-glycosyltransferases (GTs), of each CESA protein occupies the central portion of the protein sequence and is thought to face the cytosol.
	- **Callose**:
		- Callose, a ^^1,3-β-d-glucan^^ another polysaccharide ^^produced at the plant  plasma membrane^^. Microscopic examinations of ^^plant tissues stained with the callose-binding fluorochrome aniline blue^^ have localized this polysaccharide ^^to the cell plate during [[cytokinesis]]^^.

		- Callose deposition is induced by a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses.  Plants often synthesize callose plugs, or [[papillae]], at the site of pathogen ingress. These papillae are thought to impede or ensnare potential pathogen  invaders, allowing the plant to mount a more effective defense response
		- Arabidopsis contains 12 CALS genes, all members of the CAZy family GT48, and related to the FKS1 gene of yeast, a β-1,3-glucan synthase.
	- **Hemicelluloses**:
		- [[Hemicellulose]]s are defined as non-cellulosic polysaccharides, excluding pectins that associate non-covalently with cellulose and are extracted from cell walls with 1–4 M alkali solutions
			- They include [[xyloglucan]]s, arabinoxylans, galacto(gluco)mannansand mixed-linkage glucans (MLGs)
		- primary cell wall hemi[[cellulose]]s is assumed to be cross-linking adjacent 
		  [[cellulose]] microfibrils to form a three-dimensional, load-bearing structure that can resist the turgor pressure of the cell
		- [[Type I primary cell walls]], which are characteristic of most flowering plant cell walls, are composed of [[xyloglucan]] (10–20% dry weight), glucomannan (5–10%) and xylan (∼5%)
		- [[Type II primary cell walls]], which are characteristic of the family [[Poaceae]], are composed of [[xyloglucan]] (1–5%), xylan (20–40%)and MLG (10–30%)
		- Hemicelluloses are synthesized by an array of glycan synthases and glycosyltransferases.
		- hemicelluloses are synthesized in Golgi-enriched fractions, attempts to isolate 
		  hemicellulose glycan synthases using traditional biochemical protein purification techniques have been unsuccessful
		- a diverse set of cellulose synthase-like (CSL) genes in Arabidopsis and rice that belong to the cellulose synthase super family of genes Glycosyltransferases are defined as non-processive enzymes that are 
		  responsible for the addition of specific sugar residues to either the backbone of a particular polysaccharide or a nascent side chain of a polysaccharid
		- [[Hemicellulose]] glycosyltransferases characterized to date require an acceptor substrate and are type-II integral membrane proteins that contain a short N-terminal sequence residing in the cytoplasm, a single transmembrane domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain residing in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus
		- **[[xyloglucan]]**:
			- [[xyloglucan]] is composed of a 1,4-β-d-glucan backbone that is regularly 
			  substituted at the O-6 position with either α-d-xylosyl residues or side 
			  chains composed of discrete sequences of α-d-xylosyl, β-d-galactosyl 
			  and α-L-fucosyl residues, and in some species α-L-arabinose
			- two general classes based upon the xylose substitution pattern of 
			  endo-(1,4)-β-glucanase hydrolyzed [[xyloglucan]]: XXXG-type and XXGG-type 
			  [[xyloglucan]]s
			- XXXG-type [[xyloglucan]] is the most prevalent type of [[xyloglucan]] found in the majority of [[dicots]], [[monocots]] and conifers studied to date, while XXGG-type [[xyloglucan]] is found primarily in the families [[Poaceae]] and 
			  [[Solanaceae]]
				- (for an extensive comparison of species-specific [[xyloglucan]] structure, see O’Neill and York,2003; Hoffmanet al., 2005).
			- There is a considerable variation in the structure of the repeating  oligosaccharide subunits of plants containing XXGG-type [[xyloglucan]]
				- XXGG-type [[xyloglucan]] of the family [[Solanaceae]] containing 5-O-acetyl 
				  arabinosyl and 6-O-acetyl glucosylresidues (Yorket al., 1988; Kieferet al., 1989; Pauly and Scheller, 2000)
			- The mur3 locus was initially identified because of a significant decrease in cell wall fucose content
				- MUR3belongs to CAZy family GT47, which contains 38 other putative Arabidopsis glycosyltransferase genes
		- **Arabinoxylan**:
			- Arabinoxylan is the major hemicellulose in the primary cell walls of graminaceous [[monocotyledonous]] plants
			- backbone of 1,4-β-linked xylosyl residues that is regularly substituted at the O-2 and/or O-3 position with α-L-arabinose
			- The backbone of arabinoxylan is synthesized by 1,4-β-xylan synthase, which has been partially characterized in a diverse group of economically
			   important plants such as maize (Zea mays), oats (Avena sativa), bean  (Phaseolus vulgaris), pea, and wheat
		- **Galacto(gluco)mannan**:
