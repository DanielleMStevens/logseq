- **Abstract**:
	- we know relatively little of the underlying mechanisms governing [[polar growth]] or the requisite suite of factors that direct polar growth
	- [[peptidoglycan]] layer of polar-growing bacteria features unusual crosslinks and in some species the quintessential cell division proteins [[FtsA]] and [[FtsZ]] are recruited to the growing poles
	- models of polar growth in bacteria based on recent research in the 
	  Actinomycetales and Rhizobiales, with emphasis on [[Mycobacterium]] and 
	  [[Agrobacterium]] species
- **One question, many answers**:
	- Two common themes of bacterial cell growth are dispersed and zonal cell growth
	- [[Zonal growth]] concentrates the addition of new cell material to specific 
	  areas such as the midcell, whereas [[dispersed growth]] occurs in small 
	  patches along most of the cell envelope.
	- Although nearly all bacteria exhibit zonal growth during cell division
