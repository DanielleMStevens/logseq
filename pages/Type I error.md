title: Type I error
---

- 1. What is a Type I Error?
- A Type I error (or Type **1**), is the **incorrect [rejection of a true null hypothesis](https://www.statisticshowto.com/support-or-reject-null-hypothesis/)**. The alpha symbol, α, is usually used to denote a Type I error.
- The Null Hypothesis in Type I and Type II Decision Errors.
- The [null hypothesis](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/null-hypothesis/), H0 is a **commonly accepted hypothesis**; it is the opposite of the [alternate hypothesis](https://www.statisticshowto.com/what-is-an-alternate-hypothesis/). Researchers come up with an alternate hypothesis, one that they think explains a phenomenon, and then work to [reject the null hypothesis](https://www.statisticshowto.com/support-or-reject-null-hypothesis/).
- If that sounds a little convoluted, an example might help. Back in the day (way back!) scientists thought that the Earth was at the center of the Universe. That mean everything else—the sun, the planets, the Oort cloud&helip;—revolved around the Earth.

- This [Geocentric model](http://www.universetoday.com/32607/geocentric-model/), where the Earth is at the center of the universe, hassince been proven false. So the **current, accepted hypothesis (the null)** is:
	- H0: The Earth IS NOT at the center of the Universe
	- And the alternate hypothesis (the challenge to the null hypothesis) would be:
	- H1: The Earth IS at the center of the Universe.
- Type I Error: Conducting a Test
- In our sample test (__Is the Earth at the center of the Universe?__), the null hypothesis is:
- **H0: The Earth is not at the center of the Universe**
- Let’s say you’re an amateur astronomer and you’re convinced they’ve all got it wrong. You want to prove that the Earth IS at the center of the Universe. You set out to prove the alternate hypothesis and sit and watch the night sky for a few days, noticing that__ hey—it looks like all that stuff in the sky is revolving around the Earth!__ You therefore reject the null hypothesis and proudly announce that the alternate hypothesis is true; The Earth is, in fact, at the center of the Universe.
- That’s a **very simplified explanation** of a Type I Error. Of course, it’s a little more complicated than that in real life (or in this case, in statistics). But basically, when you’re conducting any kind of test, you want to minimize the chance that you could make a Type I error. In the case of the amateur astronaut, you could probably have avoided a Type I error by reading some scientific journals.
