title: 2019 MPMI International Conference
---

- **G+ Satellite Meeting**:
	- overall positive, got to meet other researchers in the Clavibacter community
	- [[Jeff H. Chang]] - gave a nice overview of why genomics is important/useful
	- [[Alexandra J. Weisberg]] - wasn't present but had a presentation on tools use for genomes
		- can find [here](https://github.com/osuchanglab/MPMIworkshop)
	- **From Clavibacter group**:
		- [[Clavibacter capsici]]
			- found a small portion of the chp/tomA pathogenicity island integrated into both plasmids
				- reported in [this paper]([[Multiple plasmid-borne virulence genes of Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. capsici critical for disease development in pepper]])
				- collected a wide variety of isolates from Korea (much of listed in [this paper]([[Plasmid composition and the chpG gene determine the virulence level of Clavibacter capsici natural isolates in pepper]]))
		- [[Clavibacter michiganensis]]
			- [[celA]] typically has 3 domains: catalytic domain, cellulose binding domain, expansion domain
			- [[F. Christopher Peritore-Galve]] - [[Christine D. Smart]] lab
				- able to do microscopy - colonization of [[Clavibacter michiganensis]] can go both down and up the xylem and eventually envade nearby cells
				- found in the protoxyelm (not metaxylem until systemic infection) - eventually infects nearby parenchymal cells
		- [[Clavibacter nebraskensis]] isolates lack the catalytic domain of [[celA]]
			- [[Frank White]] developed a high throughput disease assay - clip, dip, and seee symptoms ~5 days
			- Assymptom isolates do exist; can be very closely related to pathogens
			- Tried to use pop. gen.
				- assess SNPs between pathogens and nonpathogens
				- found geneM? - unknown function but SNP change key to relationship with host (pathogen vs. nonpathogen)
	- [[Kenichi Tsuda]] - [[Actinobacteria]] can elicit an up regulation in defense gene expression
- [[Shang Yang He]]
	- How temperature impacts defense responses? (22/24 -> 28C)
	- during elevated temp, SA pathway is down and JA + ABA are upregulated
	- they asked whether cbp60g (key to SA production) overexpression can induce SA levels at elevated temp.
- [[Ryan Melnyk]] - talk based on his recently publish work presented in [this paper]([[Convergent gain and loss of genomic islands drive lifestyle changes in plant-associated Pseudomonas]])
	- beneficial symbiotic and pathogens are closely related
	- large quorum sensing (LPQ) island not present in beneficial strains
	- gene flow controls relationship with plant host
	- able to provide phylogenetic evidence for independent island gain/loss evens
