- **Abstract**:
	- 54 natural isolates exhibited significant variation in the necrosis
	- Six isolates showed very low virulence, but their population titres in plants were not significantly different from those of the highly virulent isolates
	- all six isolates lacked the pCM1Cc plasmid that carries [[chpG]]
		- two of them, isolates 1,106 and 1,207, had the intact [[chpG]] elsewhere in the genome
		- two isolates revealed that chpG was located in the pCM2Cc plasmid, and two highly homologous regions were present next to the chpG locus
	- chpG expression in isolate 1,106 was not induced in plants
- **Introduction**:
	- At least five virulence genes in the PAI region of [[Clavibacter michiganensis]] have been found in pCM1Cc and pCM2Cc of [[Clavibacter capsici]]
	- [[celA]] gene, which encodes a cellulase and is located in pCM1Cm, is the most important virulence factor during infection in tomato plants (Jahr et al., 2000), and this gene ortholog is present in C. sepedonicus, but is missing in [[Clavibacter capsici]] and [[Clavibacter nebraskensis]]
	- Genomic profiles of the Californian isolates showed that celA in pCM1Cm and pelA, encoding a pectate lyase, in the chromosomes are essential for virulence, but there was one pathogenic isolate found in New York that lacked [[celA]]
	- no direct correlation between sequence polymorphisms observed in putative virulence genes and the ability of disease development in maize
- **Results**:
	- [[Clavibacter capsici]] isolates have natural variation in their ability to cause necrosis in pepper leaves.
	- pepper leaves inoculated with ^^low-virulence isolates contain similar titres ^^and/or only slightly lower titres ^^of bacteria than those inoculated with highly virulent isolates ^^
	- [[chpE]] and [[chpG]] as pCM1-specific virulence genes, and [[chpC]] and pat-1 as pCM2Cc-specific virulence genes & cellulase gene, [[celB]], located in the chromosome was also investigated. All the isolates had celB, but lacked the other cellulase gene, celA, which was absent from C. capsici

N, sterile water used as a negative control; M, 1 kb DNA size ladder. (b) Southern blot analysis of natural variants lacking pCM1Cc, but carrying chpG, with chpG as a probe in the digoxygenin detection system. Genomic DNAs extracted from each isolate were digested with the restriction enzyme XhoI. (c) Geographical location of C. capsici natural isolates collected in Korea.

	- [[chpC]] and pat-1 in pCM2Cc were consistently detected in all the isolates, and [[chpE]] in pCM1 was only detected in isolates carrying pCM1Cc.
	- [[chpG]] in pCM1Cc was detected not only in pCM1Cc-carrying isolates PF008, 1003, and 1985, but also in two out of the six pCM1Cc-lacking isolates, 1106 and 1207

	- The presence of chpG in the two pCM1Cc-lacking isolates was confirmed  again by Southern blot hybridization by using chpG from PF008 as a probe
	- Next 1106 carrying [[chpE]] of PF008 was generated, and its virulence was  examined. The introduction of chpE increased approximately 20% of the disease severity (Figure 6c,d), like 1101 carrying chpE.

(c) Necrotic disease symptoms on the infected leaves after infection with C. capsici isolate 1,106 and its complemented strains. All inoculated leaves were photographed at 7 dai. (d) Disease severity at 7 dai. C. capsici type strain PF008 was used as a positive control, and mock treatment with 10 mM MgCl2 and green fluorescent protein (GFP) were used as negative controls. Bars indicate SE. Different letters in (b) and (d) indicate statistically significant differences in disease severity analysed by a 
	  nonparametric Kruskalâ€“Wallis test with Dunnett's multiple comparisons (p < .05). All experiments were repeated three times and similar results were obtained
- **Discussion**:
	- The [[chpG]] homolog is present in the chromosomal PAI region of [[Clavibacter michiganensis]], but a previous study showed that a chpG single mutant produced by transposon insertion in this bacterium still showed full virulence [(Stork et al., 2008)]([[A family of [[serine proteases]]es]]es]]es]] of Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis: chpC plays a role in colonization of the host plant tomato]]).
	- Therefore, the function of [[chpG]] in the virulence of Clavibacter species may be different.
	- PF008 contains putative [[insertion elements]] and two intact [[transposase]]s, which appear to be associated with extensive genetic rearrangements such as relocation and/or integration of gene(s) or a specific region
	- A [[transposase]] in the 3.0 kb region appears to be similar to that present
	   in the [[IS1122 transposon]] discovered in the pCI1 plasmid of [[Clavibacter insidiosus]] strain R1-1
	- The presence of [IS elements]([[insertion elements]]) in the plasmid of [[Clavibacter capsici]] is probably related to the duplication or genetic rearrangement of certain DNA regions.
	- However, all the variants grew similarly in the plants. There is no direct correlation between the virulence of Clavibacter and their ability to grow in the plants
	- highly virulent isolates carrying both [[plasmids]] were present all over Korea,  while the two types of low-virulence isolates were present only in a limited area
	- [[Clavibacter sp.]] strain Enf12 confers plant growth and chilling tolerance in  Chorispora bungeana
