- **Abstract**:
	- generate unmarked in-frame gene deletions in Rhodococcus equi was developed, exploiting the cytotoxic effect of 5-fluorocytosine ([[5-FC]]) by the action of [[cytosine deaminase]] (CD) and [[uracil phosphoribosyltransferase]] (UPRT) enzyme
	- [CD]([[cytosine deaminase]]) and UPRT conferred conditional lethality to R. equi cells incubated with [[5-FC]]
	- the [CD]([[cytosine deaminase]])-UPRT based 5-FC counter-selection may become a useful asset in the generation of unmarked in-frame gene deletions in other actinobacteria as well, as actinobacteria generally appear to be [[5-FC]] resistant and 5-FU sensitive.
- **Introduction**:
	- the [[sacB]] gene of Bacillus subtilis is one of the most widely used suicide genes, conferring sucrose sensitivity mostly in Gram-negative bacteria
	- we have been unable to apply [[sacB]] as a counter-selectable marker in Rhodococcus equi, due to a lack of sucrose sensitivity. Similar observations have been reported for Streptomyces lividans
	- [[sacB]] counter-selection system generally is not applicable to other Gram-positive bacteria, like B. subtilis
	- In B. subtilis, mazF, encoding a toxin, has been used as a suicide marker to generate unmarked gene deletion mutant
	- A major drawback of these markers, however, is that they only function in glkA, pyrF, upp or strA null mutants,
	- This method, however, requires a laborious extra round of mutagenesis to remove the resistance marker integrated into the genome to generate unmarked mutant
	- [[cytosine deaminase]] (CD, EC 3.5.4.5) and [[uracil phosphoribosyltransferase]] (UPRT, EC 2.4.2.9) are enzymes involved in the pyrimidine salvage pathway, converting cytosine via uracil into dUMP
	- cytotoxicity is largely exerted following [UPRT]([[uracil phosphoribosyltransferase]]) mediated conversion of 5-FU into 5-ﬂuoro-dUMP,
	- Heterologous expression of E. coli codA was shown to confer [[5-FC]] sensitivity to mammalian cells, ordinarily not producing [CD]([[cytosine deaminase]])
	- A recent study on pyrimidine salvage in Streptomyces species indicated a lack of [[cytosine deaminase]] activity but sensitivity towards 5-FU
	- A method for the isolation of gene deletion mutants of R. equi by the double homologous recombination strategy was ﬁrst reported by Navas et al
	- These methods, however, often involve screening and handling of large numbers of colonies to select for the rare second recombination event
- **Results & Discussion**:
	- **CD-UPRT mediated 5-fluorocytosine sensitivity of R. equi strain RE1**
		- obvious prerequisite - conditionally lethal positive selection system is natural resistance of R. equi strain RE1 towards [[5-FC]]
		- Next, we examined whether expression of the E. coli genes codA and upp in R. equi would confer sensitivity to [[5-FC]] and thus could act as a suicide marker
		- The presence of the codA::upp cassette rendered R. equi sensitive to [[5-FC]], whereas expression of [codA]([[cytosine deaminase]]) alone did not result in 5-FC sensitivity
		- Growth of the R. equi strain carrying the codA::upp cassette under nonselective conditions was similar to that of wild type
		- Importantly, no [[5-FC]] selection was observed when complex agar media (LB) was used (Figure 1D). This may be due to repression of the [[pyrimidine salvage pathway]] aﬀecting 5-FC uptake.
	- **Unmarked in-frame gene deletion of supAB in R. equi**
		- electing for apramycin resistance, resulted in 29 transformants of which four were selected and grown nonselectively overnight for 20 h in LB medium
		- For one transformant, eighteen 5-FCR/ApraS colonies were checked by colony PCR for the presence of the mutant supAB genotype using PCR with oligonucleotides 6 and 7 amplifying the supAB genes

	- **Actinobacteria are generally 5-FC resistant**
		- the tested strains generally were resistant to high concentrations of [[5-FC]] (100 mg/ml), but highly sensitive to lower concentrations of 5-FU (20–50 mg/ml), indicating the feasibility of developing a 5-FC based positive selection system for other actinobacteria.
