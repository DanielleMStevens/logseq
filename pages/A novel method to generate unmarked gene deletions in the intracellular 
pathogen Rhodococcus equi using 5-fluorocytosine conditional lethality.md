- **Abstract**:
	- generate unmarked in-frame gene deletions in Rhodococcus equi was developed, exploiting the cytotoxic effect of 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) by the action of cytosine deaminase (CD) and uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT) enzyme
	- CD and UPRT conferred conditional lethality to R. equi cells incubated with 5-FC
	- the CD-UPRT based 5-FC counter-selection may become a useful asset in the generation of unmarked in-frame gene deletions in other actinobacteria as well, as actinobacteria generally appear to be 5-FC resistant and 5-FU sensitive.
- **Introduction**:
	- the [[sacB]] gene of Bacillus subtilis is one of the most widely used suicide genes, conferring sucrose sensitivity mostly in Gram-negative bacteria
	- we have been unable to apply [[sacB]] as a counter-selectable marker in Rhodococcus equi, due to a lack of sucrose sensitivity. Similar observations have been reported for Streptomyces lividans
	- [[sacB]] counter-selection system generally is not applicable to other Gram-positive bacteria, like B. subtilis
	- A major drawback of these markers, however, is that they only function in glkA, pyrF, upp or strA null mutants,
