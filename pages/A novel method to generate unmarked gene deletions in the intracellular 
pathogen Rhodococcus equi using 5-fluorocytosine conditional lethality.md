- **Abstract**:
	- generate unmarked in-frame gene deletions in Rhodococcus equi was developed, exploiting the cytotoxic effect of 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) by the action of [[cytosine deaminase]] (CD) and uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT) enzyme
	- [CD]([[cytosine deaminase]]) and UPRT conferred conditional lethality to R. equi cells incubated with 5-FC
	- the [CD]([[cytosine deaminase]])-UPRT based 5-FC counter-selection may become a useful asset in the generation of unmarked in-frame gene deletions in other actinobacteria as well, as actinobacteria generally appear to be 5-FC resistant and 5-FU sensitive.
- **Introduction**:
	- the [[sacB]] gene of Bacillus subtilis is one of the most widely used suicide genes, conferring sucrose sensitivity mostly in Gram-negative bacteria
	- we have been unable to apply [[sacB]] as a counter-selectable marker in Rhodococcus equi, due to a lack of sucrose sensitivity. Similar observations have been reported for Streptomyces lividans
	- [[sacB]] counter-selection system generally is not applicable to other Gram-positive bacteria, like B. subtilis
	- In B. subtilis, mazF, encoding a toxin, has been used as a suicide marker to generate unmarked gene deletion mutant
	- A major drawback of these markers, however, is that they only function in glkA, pyrF, upp or strA null mutants,
	- This method, however, requires a laborious extra round of mutagenesis to remove the resistance marker integrated into the genome to generate unmarked mutant
	- [[cytosine deaminase]] (CD, EC 3.5.4.5) and uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT, EC 2.4.2.9) are enzymes involved in the pyrimidine salvage pathway, converting cytosine via uracil into dUMP
	- cytotoxicity is largely exerted following UPRT mediated conversion of 5-FU into 5-ï¬‚uoro-dUMP,
	- Heterologous expression of E. coli codA was shown to confer 5-FC sensitivity to mammalian cells, ordinarily not producing CD
