- **Abstract**:
	- A transposon mutagenesis system for Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis was developed based on antibiotic resistance transposons that were derived from the insertion element IS1409 from Arthrobacter sp. strain TM1 NCIB12013
	- Analysis of Tn1409C insertion sites suggests a random mode of transposition. Transposition of Tn1409C was also demonstrated for other subspecies of C. michiganensis.
- **Introduction**:
	- To be able to identify other pathogenicity-related genes that are located on the chromosome, an efficient system for mutagenesis would be beneficial
	- IS (insertion sequence) element IS1409 from the actinomycete Arthrobacter sp. strain TM1 NCIB12013 and the construction of a family of artificial transposons
	- previously published procedure (Meletzus et al. 2000) yielded only between 0 and 5 transposon mutants per µg of vector DNA, which requires a tremendous effort to obtain a specific mutant
- **Results**:
	- **Optimization of the electroporation protocol.**
		- growth phase (early, middle, and late log phase, and stationary phase), amount of cells per transformation assay (1 × 108 to 1 × 109), amount of DNA (0.01 to 5 µg), and methylation status of DNA (isolated either from the dam–/ dcm– Escherichia coli strain WA337 or the dam+/dcm+ E. coli strain JM109)
		- Also, the effect of electrical parameters (parallel resistances 200 to 1,000 Ω) and treatment of competent cells with cell wall-damaging reagents during growth (glycine, lysozyme, and penicillin G) or directly before electroporation (glycine) were tested.
		- Cells harvested during early log phase (optical density [OD]580 0.5 to 0.7) gave a significantly higher transformation rate than cells harvested during later growth phases.
		- The highest efficiency was obtained with a parallel resistance of 600 Ω. Treatment of cells with a heat shock (32 to 38°C for 6 min) directly after the pulse reduced survival and consecutively reduced transformation efficiency
		- A longer regeneration time (2 to 4 h) had no effect on survival or on the amount of transformants
		- Using unmethylated DNA isolated from E. coli WA337 (dam–/dcm–), the number of transformants was increased fourfold in contrast to DNA from E. coli JM109 (dam+/dcm+) (Fig. 1).
	- **Protocol for transposon mutagenesis with Tn1409C.**
		- plasmid pKGT452C was used, consisting of vector pUC13 carrying Tn1409C with the chloramphenicol exporter gene cmx from Corynebacterium striatum
		- 1,000 resistant clones per electroporation were generally obtained when using pKGT452Cβ, whereas yields with pKGT452Cα were approximately 40 times lower
	- **Analysis of transposition sites.**
		- Southern hybridization experiments with 75 randomly selected chloramphenicol resistant clones were performed
		- fragments of different sizes, but larger than the minimal size of 1,988 bp (Fig. 2B I.), indicating a random insertion of Tn1409C
		- The duplication of 8 bp as typical for IS1409 was confirmed in the 10 transposition mutants, as shown in Table 1
		- No apparent consensus sequence was found, indicating a random mode of transposition of Tn1409.
		- Besides integration of the transposon into housekeeping genes, one integration occurred in a protease gene. The other integration sites were located in open reading frames for hypothetical proteins.
