- **Abstract**:
	- A transposon mutagenesis system for Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis was developed based on antibiotic resistance transposons that were derived from the insertion element IS1409 from Arthrobacter sp. strain TM1 NCIB12013
	- Analysis of Tn1409C insertion sites suggests a random mode of transposition. Transposition of Tn1409C was also demonstrated for other subspecies of C. michiganensis.
- **Introduction**:
	- To be able to identify other pathogenicity-related genes that are located on the chromosome, an efficient system for mutagenesis would be beneficial
	- IS (insertion sequence) element IS1409 from the actinomycete Arthrobacter sp. strain TM1 NCIB12013 and the construction of a family of artificial transposons
	- previously published procedure (Meletzus et al. 2000) yielded only between 0 and 5 transposon mutants per µg of vector DNA, which requires a tremendous effort to obtain a specific mutant
- **Results**:
	- **Optimization of the electroporation protocol.**
		- growth phase (early, middle, and late log phase, and stationary phase), amount of cells per transformation assay (1 × 108 to 1 × 109), amount of DNA (0.01 to 5 µg), and methylation status of DNA (isolated either from the dam–/ dcm– Escherichia coli strain WA337 or the dam+/dcm+ E. coli strain JM109)
- **Discussion**:
