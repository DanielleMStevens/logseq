		- Southern hybridization experiments with 75 randomly selected chloramphenicol resistant clones were performed
		- fragments of different sizes, but larger than the minimal size of 1,988 bp (Fig. 2B I.), indicating a random insertion of Tn1409C

		- The duplication of 8 bp as typical for IS1409 was confirmed in the 10 transposition mutants, as shown in Table 1
		- No apparent consensus sequence was found, indicating a random mode of transposition of Tn1409.
		- Besides integration of the transposon into housekeeping genes, one integration occurred in a protease gene. The other integration sites were located in open reading frames for hypothetical proteins.
		- one mutant was grown on a TBY plate without antibiotics over a period of 6 months with transfer to a fresh plate every 2 weeks. After 6 months, total DNA was isolated from 10 randomly chosen colonies, digested with BglII, and probed with the tnpA probe. No change in the band pattern compared with the original was observed after continuous growth for 6 months (data not shown), indicating that the transposon mutants obtained with Tn1409C are stable.
	- **Mutagenesis of C.michiganensis subsp. insidiosus, subsp. nebraskensis, and subsp. sepedonicus.**
		- Clavibacter strains against the internal 1-kb SstI fragment of IS1409 did not give a signal (Gartemann and Eichenlaub 2001). This indicates that these strains do not carry an IS1409-like insertion element and reduces the possibility for homologous recombination with endogenous IS elements.
		- transposon Tn1409C should also be a valuable tool in other subspecies of C. michiganensis, provided that the transformation rate can be improved

- **Discussion**:
	- The highest rate of transposition was achieved with the transposon construct in which the resistance gene and the transposase gene are transcribed in the same direction, which may allow a readthrough into the transposase gene from the promoter of the resistance gene.
	- Especially, replacing a wild-type gene with an insertionally inactivated one as a method of testing the phenotype of a hypothetical gene now becomes possible in C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis.
