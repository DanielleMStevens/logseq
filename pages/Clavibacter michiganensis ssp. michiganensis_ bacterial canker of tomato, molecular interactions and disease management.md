- **Abstract**:
	- A transposon mutagenesis system for Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis was developed based on antibiotic resistance transposons that were derived from the insertion element IS1409 from Arthrobacter sp. strain TM1 NCIB12013
	- Analysis of Tn1409C insertion sites suggests a random mode of transposition. Transposition of Tn1409C was also demonstrated for other subspecies of C. michiganensis.
- **Introduction**:
	- To be able to identify other pathogenicity-related genes that are located on the chromosome, an efficient system for mutagenesis would be beneficial
	- IS (insertion sequence) element IS1409 from the actinomycete Arthrobacter sp. strain TM1 NCIB12013 and the construction of a family of artificial transposons
	- previously published procedure (Meletzus et al. 2000) yielded only between 0 and 5 transposon mutants per µg of vector DNA, which requires a tremendous effort to obtain a specific mutant
- **Results**:
	- **Optimization of the electroporation protocol.**
		- growth phase (early, middle, and late log phase, and stationary phase), amount of cells per transformation assay (1 × 108 to 1 × 109), amount of DNA (0.01 to 5 µg), and methylation status of DNA (isolated either from the dam–/ dcm– Escherichia coli strain WA337 or the dam+/dcm+ E. coli strain JM109)
		- Also, the effect of electrical parameters (parallel resistances 200 to 1,000 Ω) and treatment of competent cells with cell wall-damaging reagents during growth (glycine, lysozyme, and penicillin G) or directly before electroporation (glycine) were tested.
		- Cells harvested during early log phase (optical density [OD]580 0.5 to 0.7) gave a significantly higher transformation rate than cells harvested during later growth phases.
		- The highest efficiency was obtained with a parallel resistance of 600 Ω. Treatment of cells with a heat shock (32 to 38°C for 6 min) directly after the pulse reduced survival and consecutively reduced transformation efficiency
		- A longer regeneration time (2 to 4 h) had no effect on survival or on the amount of transformants
		- Using unmethylated DNA isolated from E. coli WA337 (dam–/dcm–), the number of transformants was increased fourfold in contrast to DNA from E. coli JM109 (dam+/dcm+) (Fig. 1).
	- **Protocol for transposon mutagenesis with Tn1409C.**
		- plasmid pKGT452C was used, consisting of vector pUC13 carrying Tn1409C with the chloramphenicol exporter gene cmx from Corynebacterium striatum
		- 1,000 resistant clones per electroporation were generally obtained when using pKGT452Cβ, whereas yields with pKGT452Cα were approximately 40 times lower
	- **Analysis of transposition sites.**
		- Southern hybridization experiments with 75 randomly selected chloramphenicol resistant clones were performed
		- fragments of different sizes, but larger than the minimal size of 1,988 bp (Fig. 2B I.), indicating a random insertion of Tn1409C

		- The duplication of 8 bp as typical for IS1409 was confirmed in the 10 transposition mutants, as shown in Table 1
		- No apparent consensus sequence was found, indicating a random mode of transposition of Tn1409.
		- Besides integration of the transposon into housekeeping genes, one integration occurred in a protease gene. The other integration sites were located in open reading frames for hypothetical proteins.
		- one mutant was grown on a TBY plate without antibiotics over a period of 6 months with transfer to a fresh plate every 2 weeks. After 6 months, total DNA was isolated from 10 randomly chosen colonies, digested with BglII, and probed with the tnpA probe. No change in the band pattern compared with the original was observed after continuous growth for 6 months (data not shown), indicating that the transposon mutants obtained with Tn1409C are stable.
	- **Mutagenesis of C.michiganensis subsp. insidiosus, subsp. nebraskensis, and subsp. sepedonicus.**
		- Clavibacter strains against the internal 1-kb SstI fragment of IS1409 did not give a signal (Gartemann and Eichenlaub 2001). This indicates that these strains do not carry an IS1409-like insertion element and reduces the possibility for homologous recombination with endogenous IS elements.
		- transposon Tn1409C should also be a valuable tool in other subspecies of C. michiganensis, provided that the transformation rate can be improved
- **Discussion**:
