title: PLP228 - Coconut Lethal Yellowing Diseases
---

- **LYD: A complex disease**
	- ^^Syndroms^^
		- America: Coconut leathal yellowing, lethal yellowing, Yucatan coconut lethal decline, lethal yellowing disease, Texas Phoenix plam decline (TPPD), C. palata yellows, Sabal mexicana lethal declne
		- Africa: Coconut lethal disease, Awka disease, Cape St. Paul wilt, Keta disease, Kaincope, Kribi disease, Cote d'Ivoire lethal yellowing
		- Asia: Kerala wilt disease, root (wilt) disease, weligama coconut leaf wilt disease, coconut yellow decline, kalimantan wilt, natuna wilt
		- Oceania: bogia coconut syndrome
	- Affects approximately 40 palm species
		- Aracaeae and Pandanaceae
- __Cadidatus__ Phytoplasma palmae
	- First reports in 1912
		- Viruses
		- Mineral deficiencies
		- 'hartrot' - trypanosomatids
		- 'red ring' - nematodes
	- MLO bodies 1972-1974
	- Phytoplasma 1993
	- Ca. P. palmaw and Ca. P. cocostanzaniae 2004
	- Ca. P. palmicola 2014
- Coconut Lethal Disease: vector, bacteria, and plant
	- Transmitted by __Haplaxius crudus __ (Palm Cixiid)
- Pathogenicity factors?
	- Nutdrop and Flower abscission
	- Biochemical and physiological abnormalities in roots
		- Respiration
		- Total Sugars
		- Reducing sugars
	- Alteration in phloem flux rates
	- Changes in water relations
		- Irreversible suppresssion of leaf stomatal conductance
	- Reduction of photosyntheic capacity
- Phloem-limited bacterial effectors
	- Phytoplasma effectors can move through the plant via plasmodesmata
- Phytoplasma effectors can phenocopy disease
	- Plants expressing Phytoplasma effectors phenocopy disease
	- SAP11 supress JA response in __N. bethamiana__ increasing susceptibility to insect vectors
	- **Plant sterility**
		- TENGU
		- Downregulates jasmonic acid and auxin pathways
		- Auxin response factor ARF6/ARF8
	- **Leaf like flowers**
		- Phyllogen
		- Phylov and SAP54
		- ABCE-class MADS domain transcription factors
		- RAD23
	- **Vector attraction and plant immunity suspression**
		- SAP54 SWP12 and SWP21 (TENGU-like)
- Management
	- Black's approach
		- On-farm quarentine
		- Weekly surveillence
			- Plantation scale surveys
			- Multispectral imaging
		- Remove and burn symptomatic plants
		- Replanting with reistant genotypes and hybrids
			- Clonal propegation
			- CRISPER
		- Whole farm weed control
			- Non-host cover crops
		- Good fertilization
	- Restricit movement of plant material
	- Injection of tetracycline type
		- Ornamental and valuable
	- Insecticide use
	- Intercropping
