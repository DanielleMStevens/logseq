- **Abstract**:
	- However, virulence factors involved in the formation of blister-like spots, which play an important role in Cmm secondary spread in tomato nurseries, are largely unknown
	- (GFP)-labelled [[NCPPB  382]] indicates that penetration occurs mainly through [[trichomes]]
	- wild-type Cmm382 and [[Cmm100]] (lacking plasmids pCM1 and pCM2) strains form blister-like spots on leaves, whereas [[Cmm27]] (lacking the chp/tomA pathogenicity island) is non-pathogenic, indicating that plasmid-borne genes, which have a crucial role in wilting, are not required for blister formation.
	- Plant gene expression studies suggest that [[chpC]] is involved in the suppression of host defence
- **Introduction**:
	- Disease symptoms on tomato plants vary depending on the type of infection (systemic vs. localized), cultivar susceptibility, host age at infection and nutritional status of the host
	- unilateral wilting of leaves and leaflets, followed by wilting of the whole plant, necrosis and cankers on the stems and petiole
	- penetrates the host plant through natural openings, such as stomata and [[hydathodes]], and through broken [[trichomes]]
	- epiphytic inoculum may disperse the disease to nearby healthy plants by splashing rain, overhead irrigation or spraying of chemicals
	- Foliar trichomes of tomato are additional favourable sites for the penetration of Cmm [(Layne, 1967)](Layne, R.E.C. (1967) Foliar trichomes and their importance as infection sites for Corynebacterium michiganense on tomato. Phytopathology, 57, 981–985.)
	- The susceptibility of leaves is generally correlated with the density of trichomes, and young leaves with the greatest hair density are more  vulnerable to disease development than are older leaves
	- A [[NCPPB  382]] derivative with a deletion of the complete PAI region, but 
	  carrying both plasmids (strain [[Cmm27]]), is impaired in the ability to 
	  induce disease symptoms and to colonize xylem vessels
	- Genes encoding chymotrypsin-related [[serine proteases]] (11 members) 
	  represent a second group of virulence factors, which were designated as 
	  the Ppa family [(Gartemann et al., 2008)]([[The Genome Sequence of the Tomato-Pathogenic Actinomycete Clavibacter michiganenesis subsp. michiganensis NCPPB 382 Reveals a Large Island Involved in Pathogenicity]])
		- With the exception of ppaJ, which is located on the pCM1 plasmid, the other family members are chromosomal.
		- Six of them (ppaA to ppaE) are located in the chp region of the [[chp/tomA]] PAI and the rest (ppaF to ppaI) in two different chromosomal loci.
	- The third group is the three-member family of subtilase proteases: one gene ([[sbtA]]) is located on the chp region of the PAI, whereas the other two genes (sbtB and sbtC) are present elsewhere on the chromosome.
	- A gene homologous to the plasmid-borne celA ([[celB]]), but lacking the a-expansin-like domain, is present on the chromosome
	- some genes encoding cell wall-degrading enzymes have been found to be induced at early stages of the disease
	- [[Cmm27]] showed a significant increase in the relative expression of two 
	  genes encoding pathogenesisrelated (PR) proteins (chitinase II and PR5 
	  isoform), when compared with plants infected with [[NCPPB  382]] or [[Cmm100]] containing the intact [[chp/tomA]] PAI
	- [[chpC]], a serine protease residing on the PAI, is involved in the suppression of host defence.
- **Results**:
	- **Blister formation on tomato leaves by Cmm**:
		- The lesions ranged in size from 0.5 to 3 mm in diameter, depending on the density with which they developed on the adaxial surface of the leaflets
		- Generally, blisters developed near trichomes that were probably damaged during spray inoculation of the leaves with the pathogen
		- [[Cmm100]] caused blisters similar to the wild-type [[NCPPB  382]], whereas [[Cmm27]] did not cause any symptoms
		- The determination of endophytic populations of Cmm mutants in leaves revealed that, 3 days after spray inoculation, [[Cmm100]] colonized the leaves at a titre of $$10^8$$ colony-forming units (CFU)/g, whereas [[Cmm27]] reached a titre of only $$10^4$$ CFU/g
		- mutants from the leaves to the stem revealed that the [[Cmm100]] population 
		  in the stem at 7 dpi was similar to that of the wild-type ($$10^5$$ CFU/g), whereas [[Cmm27]] could not be detected in the stems even after 21 dpi (Fig. S1b)

		  **Fig. S1: Endophytic growth of Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. michiganensis (Cmm) at the early stages of blister formation.** Three-week-old tomato plants were spray inoculated with bacterial suspensions ($$10^8$$ cells/mL) of Cmm382, Cmm100, Cmm27, and chpC mutants. Endophytic populations were measured in the first two leaves (a) and stem (b) at different time points after inoculation. The results presented are the average of three plants for each time point. The experiment was repeated three times with similar results.
	- **Contribution of virulence genes to the development of blister and wilt symptoms**:
		- These included genes encoding [[serine proteases]] from three different families located on the [[chp/tomA]] PAI (chpC, [[chpG]], chpE, chpF, ppaA, ppaC, sbtA), [[serine proteases]] located on the chromosome (sbtB and sbtC) and genes encoding cell wall-degrading enzymes (xysA and xysB encoding xylanases, celB encoding a cellulase, pgaA encoding a polygalacturonase and endX/Y encoding two endoglucanases)
		- Additional genes examined included: gmdA and manB (involved in 
		  exopolysaccharide synthesis), [[vatr2]] (encoding a transcriptional regulator), perF (encoding a protein possibly involved in cytolysis processes, CMM_2382) and srtA (encoding a putative sortase enzyme, CMM_0013, that anchors surface proteins)

		  **Fig. 3: Disease incidence and severity of Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. michiganensis mutants on tomato plants. **Tomato seedlings were either 
		  spray inoculated (a) or puncture inoculated (b) with the wild-type Cmm382 and its mutants, and monitored for blister formation or wilting at 7 and 15 days post-inoculation (dpi), respectively. The different mutants are listed in Table 1. The grades for disease severity were as follows: for blister formation: weak (1–10 blisters per plant), moderate (10–50 blisters per plant) and severe (above 50 blisters per plant); for wilting: weak (one wilted leaf per plant), moderate (two to four wilted leaves per plant) and severe (above four wilted leaves per plant or dead plant). *Statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) in disease incidence compared with Cmm382, according to Student's t-test.
	- **Differential expression of putative virulence genes during blister formation compared with wilting:**
		- blister formation caused by the [[Cmm100]] mutant was similar to that of the wild-type, whereas wilting was completely impaired
		- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FQualifying_Exam%2FcayOP-03CL.png?alt=media&token=13af1273-4515-4bc4-b0d9-c0821650f7a5)
		- [[celA]] and pat-1, two virulence determinants residing on pCM1 and pCM2, 
		  respectively, might not be expressed during blister formation.
		- Inactivation of [[chpC]], [[sbtA]] and [[vatr2]] reduced both blister formation and wilting
			- chpC, sbtA and vatr2 transcripts could be measured as early as 8–16 h in 
			  Cmm-treated leaves, whereas, in infected stems, chpC and vatr2 transcripts accumulated later, after 72 h and 24 h, respectively, and that of sbtA remained unchanged
		- Inactivation of pgaA, endX/Y, perF and srtA genes significantly reduced blister formation, but not wilting
			- The expression levels of these genes in the wild-type following spray  inoculation were highly induced early (at 8–16 h), whereas these genes 
			  were barely expressed following puncture inoculation
	- **Expression of plant defence-related genes in response to infection by Cmm382 and chpC mutant:**
		- The plant genes were selected based on proteomic analysis of Cmm-inoculated tomato plant
			- three [ACO1 (1-aminocyclopropane1-carboxylic acid (ACC) oxidase 1), PR4 
			  (pathogenesis-related protein 4) and AMSP (auxin-mediated signal pathway)] were induced significantly during blister formation, when leaves were infected with the [[chpC]] mutant relative to the wild-type
			- The transcript level of PR5-Iso (pathogenesis-related protein 5 isoform) was reduced by 1.6-fold compared with the wild-type
			- the relative expression levels of ACO1, PR3 (pathogenesis-related protein 3), PR4, PR5-Iso, PR7 (pathogenesis-related protein 7) and SBT (subtilase) were 3.6-, two-, 1.6-, 1.7-, nine- and six-fold higher, respectively, in plants inoculated with the chpC mutant compared with Cmm382

		  **Fig. 5: Relative expression of plant defence-related genes in response to 
		  infection by Cmm382 and chpC mutant.**
			- Total RNA was extracted from infected leaves (a) and stems (b) at 24 h post-inoculation and the expression level was measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Transcripts of the tested genes were normalized using GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) as an internal reference and mock-inoculated plants as control. Results represent the mean of three different experiments with three replicates for each time point. Vertical bars represent the standard error. Cmm, Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. michiganensis.

- **Discussion**:
	- Layne (1967) showed that infection occurs primarily on the upper leaf surfaces with younger leaves being more susceptible than older ones
	- The presence of trichomes is not essential for infection by Cmm, because it can also invade plants via stomata and wounds
	- genes responsible for penetration and blister formation reside on the chromosome
	- When seven serine protease mutants (Table 1) were tested for their ability to form blisters on leaves or wilting, only the mutants in [[chpC]] and [[sbtA]] significantly reduced symptom development
	- The [[chpC]] mutant, unlike [[Cmm27]], could multiply endophytically in the mesophyll and move down to the stem, suggesting that additional genes located on the PAI are required for movement of the pathogen
	- The two other tested proteases of the Ppa family ([[ppaA]] and [[ppaC]]) did not affect disease symptom
	- It is possible that they act synergistically during penetration and movement in the host
	- Progress in elucidating the function of cysteine proteases has been achieved with Gram-negative phytopathogenic bacteria
	- recent study has reported that Chp-7, a serine protease of [[Clavibacter sepedonicus]], induces a hypersensitive response (HR) in the apoplast of Nicotiana tabacum
	- it is also possible that several [[serine proteases]] have overlapping substrate specificities, thus masking phenotypes in single mutations
	- The expression of [[celA]], [[celB]], pelA1, xysA and xysB at 96 hpi of tomato seedlings has been demonstrated by qRT-PCR (Chalupowicz et al., 2010), and the proteins have been shown to be secreted into the xylem sap by proteomic analysis
	- mutation in pgaA (encoding polygalacturonase) and endX/Y (encoding endoglucanase) reduced blister formation in infected tomato leaves, but did not affect wilting
	- [[CAZymes]] have been speculated to be involved in the elicitation of 
	  oligosaccharides, which, in turn, cause changes in membrane permeability
	   and symptom development of [[Clavibacter michiganensis]]
	- it can be hypothesized that entry through natural openings, such as [[trichomes]] or stomata, requires the expression of [[CAZymes]], whereas entry through wounds, which provides the nutritional components necessary for initial proliferation within the plant, does not
	- suggesting that the expression of pgaA and endX/Y is under the control of [[chpC]]
	- Sortase enzymes in Gram-positive bacteria function as cysteine  transpeptidases, which can bind proteins to the cell surface by covalently joining them to the cell wall
	- he gene encoding the [ACO1 enzyme]([[Ethylene Biosynthesis]]), which catalyses the final step of ethylene biosynthesis, and the pathogenesis-related gene PR4 were significantly induced in chpC mutant-infected plant
