- **Abstract**:
	- Of 11 strains evaluated, all contained either a 90-kb (pCSL1) or a 140-kb (pCSL2) linear plasmid.
- **Introduction**:
	- High genetic similarity values (>88%) were obtained by hierarchical analysis of HindIII and EcoRI genomic fingerprints
	- Differences between the genomic fingerprints of virulent and avirulent 
	  stains of C. michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus were also detected
	- The genome of most strains of C. michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus contains a single 50-kb circular plasmid, designated [[pCS1]]
	- ClaI, an AT-rich recognition site enzyme, cuts pCS1 at only a few locations
- **Results**:
	- In 10 of the 11 strains, the size of the bright band was about 90 kb
	- In contrast,ClaI digestion of the bright bands from CIC31, ATCC 33113, 
	  and P45 produced multiple (10) bands of greater size than those reported for pCS1
	- BamHI, a GC-rich recognition site enzyme; several fragments not reported
	   for [[pCS1]] were detected after BamHI digestion of 90- and 140-kb bands
	- The plasmid is present at about five copies per cell
	- The BclI restriction pattern of the plasmid from the virulent strain 
	  ATCC 33113, in particular, was not the same as those obtained from the 
	  avirulent strains P45 and BCP45, even though these plasmids have 
	  identical SpeI patterns
- **Discussion**:
	- We propose the terms pCSL1 and pCSL2 for the 90- and 140-kb plasmids, respectively.
	- Linear plasmids, which occur frequently in Actinomycetales, are 
	  receiving considerable attention because of their importance in 
	  virulence, promotion of genetic variability, and production of 
	  antibiotics
- **Other notes**:
	- Closed circular supercoiled plasmids migrate slowly in pulsed-field 
	  gels, while open circular forms typically remain trapped in the sample 
	  well
	- Linear plasmids, in contrast, migrate in a 
	  pulse-time-dependent manner and at a rate that allows accurate size 
	  estimation
