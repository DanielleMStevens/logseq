- **Abstract**:
	- Genes for seven putative [[serine proteases]] (ChpA–[[chpG]]) belonging to the 
	  trypsin subfamily and homologous to the virulence factor [[pat-1]]
	- Their putative function is suggested by two motifs and an aspartate residue typical for [[serine proteases]].
	- The genes [[chpA]], [[chpB]] and [[chpD]] are pseudogenes as they contain frame shifts and/or in-frame stop codons.
	- [[chpG]] mutant was not impaired in virulence
	- in planta the titre of the [[chpC]] mutant was drastically reduced and only weak disease symptoms were observed
- **Introduction**:
	- the gene celA coding for an endo-β-1,4-glucanase on plasmid [[pCM1]] and the gene pat-1 encoding a putative serine protease on plasmid [[pCM2]]
	- When both plasmids are lost a complete loss of virulence results and the typical wilting symptoms do not occur, although the bacteria are still able to colonize the host plant
	- three homologous genes of [[pat-1]], termed phpA/B, carried on plasmid pCM2, and the pseudogene chpA, located on the chromosome
	- [[Clavibacter sepedonicus]] is the causal agent of bacterial wilt and ring rot of potato and also carries several [[pat-1]] homologous genes
		- It was shown that during infection three [[pat-1]] homologous genes were downregulated and two were upregulated, implying an involvement of these genes in the infection process
- **Results**:
	- **Features of the Pat-1 protein family**:
		- [[chpB]] contains a frame shift 138 nt downstream of the ATG start codon
		- [[chpD]] has a frame shift at position 114 downstream of the ATG start codon and an in-frame stop codon at position 547–549

		- All [[pat-1]] homologues have a putative signal peptide indicating that these proteins are secreted. Two motifs characteristic for [[serine proteases]] of the trypsin type ([LIVM][ST]A[STAG]HC and [DNSTAGC][GSTAPIMVQH]x(2)G[DE]SG[GS][SAPHV][LIVMFYWH][LIVMFYSTANQH]-PROSITE, PDOC00124) are highly conserved.
		- [[pat-1]] family homologs have 277–286 amino acid residues and molecular weights of between 29.0 and 35.8 kDa. The [[G+C content]] of the genes varies between 51.9 and 65.5 mol%
		- codon usage deviates from the normal codon usage of Cmm.
		- A putative sortase motif with homology to (LPXTG) (Mazmanian et al., 2001), which may be important for anchoring of the protein to the cell wall, was identiﬁed only in [[pat-1]] and the [[chpA]] pseudogene

			- Pseudogenes are marked with asteriks. They contain ‘X’ introduced to restore the reading frame. Conserved cysteines, the conserved aspartate of the catalytic triad, the two [[serine proteases]] motifs and the putative sortase motif (LPGSG) are also indicated. The three amino acid residues (H, D, S) of the catalytic triad are exhibited below the alignment. The arrow marks the hypothetical processing site (AQA↓V) although this motif is not conserved in all putative gene products.

	- **Construction of chpC and chpG mutants**:
		- During electroporation of the wild-type strain [[NCPPB  382]] we frequently 
		  observed loss of plasmid pCM2. Such derivatives, termed CMM101 (still carry plasmid pCM1), are still virulent and able to colonize tomato plants efficiently
	- **Assessment of virulence of chpC and chpG mutants**:
		- CMM101chpCβ displayed very weak virulence; only seven of 64 plants showed symptoms with curled and wilting leaves 28 days post-infection (dpi)
		- CMM101 as control, showed curled and wilting leaves in 32 of 64 plants already 15 to 16 dp
		- Although there are variations in the sensitivity of the tomato plants to infection and general vitality of the plants due to seasonal effects
		- we found that strain CMM101chpCβ did not colonize the plants as well as the reference strain CMM101 or wild-type Cmm NCPPB382
		- The generation times of the chpC and the chpG mutants compared  with 
		  CMM101 did not differ and were 2.5 h in rich medium and 4 h in minimal 
		  medium, respectively
		- chpG mutant CMM101chpGβ was not affected in virulence and colonization of the host plant
		- in planta indicated no signiﬁcant difference

- **Discussion**:
	- [[pat-1]] and the homologous proteins may comprise a family of [[serine proteases]] belonging to the chymotrypsin subfamily S1A
	- chpC, chpE, chpF and chpG may encode functional [[serine proteases]]; however, when Cmm is grown in rich or minimal media the supernatant contains no protease activity when tested with common serine protease substrates, such as casein, azocasein and azocoll
	- pat-1 homologous genes in [[Clavibacter sepedonicus]] were also expressed in rich medium [(Holtsmark et al., 2008)]([[Expression of putative virulence factors in the potato pathogen Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus during infection]])
		- depending on which pat-1 homologous gene was tested the transcript level
		   decreased or increased during infection of the host plant, indicating 
		  that expression of these genes is indeed affected in the interaction 
		  with the host tomato.
	- a correlation seems to exist between development of wilting symptoms and the bacterial titre in planta
	- Cmm is auxotrophic for methionine, thiamine and nicotinic acid
	- [[chpC]] serine protease degrades or processes speciﬁc proteins of either 
	  plant or bacterial origin to enrich the xylem ﬂuid with nutrients
	- or that [[chpC]] generates a signal which induces the plant to secrete nutrients into the xylem ﬂuid
	- the extracellular serine protease of Fusarium eumartii belonging to the subtilase subfamily was shown to degrade potato pathogenesisrelated (PR) proteins as well as speciﬁc polypeptides in the intercellular washing ﬂuid and cell-wall proteins from potato tubers
