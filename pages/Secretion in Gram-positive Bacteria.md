- **General Secretory Pathway (SEC) Secretion**:
	- 2 pathways
		- 1. Co-translational translocation
			- - ribosome begins translating sequencing
- signal recognition particle (SRP) recognizes and binds to signal peptide
- membrane receptor FtsY binds to ribosome-SRP complex
  -push/thread peptide sequence (not folded) through SecYEG where SPase cleaves the signal peptide sequence at [[AXA motif]]
		- 2. Post-translational export:
			- - full translated (non-folded) protein are produced and held in unfolded secretion-competent state by post-translational interacting proteins and general chaperons
- SecA translocates proteins through SecYEG using ATP hydrolsys energy
- SecDF aids in release from SecYEG
- SPase cleaves the signal peptide sequence at [[AXA motif]]
-
- **Twin-arginine translocation (Tat) Secretion**:
	- - fully synthesized protein is folded (sometimes help from cofactors)
- energy to push the protein through the TatA (cannal) is via the [[proton motor force]]
- TatB and TatC assist process and SPase cleaves signal peptide sequence at [[AXA motif]]

	  **General features of Sec and Tat signal peptides**. Sec and Tat signal peptides possess a similar tripartite overall structure consisting of a positively charged n-region, a central hydrophobic h-region, and a polar c-region that contains the recognition site (consensus: A-X-A) for signal peptidase (SPase; the cleavage site is indicated by an arrow). In Tat signal peptides,^^ a characteristic amino acid consensus motif including two highly conserved arginine residues (underlined) is present at the boundary between the often significantly longer n-region and the h-region^^. Furthermore, the h-region of ^^Tat signal peptides is mostly less hydrophobic than those found in Sec signal ^^peptides and in the ^^c-region of Tat signal peptides^^, frequently positively charged amino acids (the so-called Sec-avoidance motif) are present that prevent a mistargeting of Tat substrates into the Sec pathway
