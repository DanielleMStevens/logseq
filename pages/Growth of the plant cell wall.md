## **Tags**: #[[Type I primary cell walls]]

## **Abstract**:

## **Introduction**:
### Plants comprise of ~35 cell types, each of which is distinctive in its size, shape, position and wall characteristics

### the wall is typically a thin, flexible layer (0.1–1 µm) that consists primarily of complex polysaccharides and a small amount of structural proteins.

### Because the cells are tightly glued together through their cell walls, cell migration is not possible and plant morphogenesis is mostly a matter of localized cell division and selective cell enlargement

### some of the largest plant cells are [[xylem]] vessels (FIG. 1b), which can 
increase in volume >30,000-fold from their meristatic initials

### Such growth is accomplished through enlargement of the cell volume owing to water uptake into the vacole and irreversible extension of the pre-existing cell wall. 

### Simultaneously, new polymers are integrated into the wall to prevent it becoming thinner and weaker.
#### The [[primary cell wall]]:: is the flexible extracellular matrix that is deposited while the cell is expanding.

### [[Secondary Cell Wall]], which is deposited after cells cease enlargement and often has a distinctive composition and organization
#### The [[Secondary Cell Wall]]:: is the flexible extracellular matrix that is deposited while the cell is still expanding is known as the [[primary cell wall]]. When expansion ceases, a secondary wall is sometimes laid down inside the primary wall, making it stronger.

## **Building the primary cell wall**:
### the growing cell wall, with crystalline [[cellulose]] microfibrils that are embedded in a matrix of complex polysaccharides, which are divided into two classes:
#### [[Pectin]]s are wall polysaccharides that are solubilized by aqueous buffers and dilute acidic solutions or calcium chelator

#### [[Hemicellulose]]s, on the other hand, require strong alkali for solubilization. [[Hemicellulose]]s are cellulose-binding polysaccharides, which together with cellulose form a network that is strong yet resilient.

### The [[cellulose]] microfibrils are a tough, inelastic fibre wrapped in layers (lamellae) within the plant cell wall. Composed of (1,4)-linked β-d-glucosyl residues.

### [[Pectin]]s form hydrated gels that push microfibrils apart, easing their sideways slippage during cell growth, while also locking them in place when growth ceases.

### [[Pectin]]s are important determinants of wall porosity and wall thickness and they glue cells together in an adhesive layer called the [[middle lamella]].

### [[Pectin]]s are primary targets of attack by invading microbes and their breakdown products function as potent elicitors of plant-defence responses.

### [[cellulose]] is synthesized by large membrane complexeswhich extrude a microfibril from the cell surface, similar to a spider’s thread

### By contrast, [[matrix polysaccharide]]s are synthesized in the Golgi apparatus and packaged into tiny vesicles that fuse with the plasma membrane and thereby deliver their cargo to the wall.

### [[matrix polysaccharide]]s then become integrated into the wall network by 
physical interactions, enzymatic ligations and crosslinking reactions.

### Unlike [[cellulose]] microfibrils, newly secreted matrix polysaccharides can diffuse some distance into the cell wall, aided by cell tugor pressure, which stretches the cell wall, increases its porosity and provides an energy gradient to drive polymers into the wall

### **Cellulose synthesis**
#### Plant cellulose synthase (CESA) genes were identified in the late 1990s through molecular and genetic studies

#### In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the CESA family contains ten genes, which are expressed in different tissues and cell types.

#### For example, CESA1, CESA3 and CESA6 are required for biosynthesis of the
primary cell walls, whereas CESA4, CESA7 and CESA8 are required to form [[Secondary Cell Wall]]

#### CESA proteins are embedded in the plasma membrane in hexameric arrays called particle rosettes (FIG. 3a)

#### The assembly of CESA subunits into hexamers is not well understood, but is thought to require CESA dimerization, which is mediated by two zinc fingers in the N-terminal region of the CESA proteins

#### Each [[cellulose]] microfibril is formed from the spontaneous ‘bundling’ and crystallization of dozens of (1,4)-linked β-d-glucan chains, each made by a CESA protein (FIG. 3c)

#### [[cellulose]] microfibrils are 3–5 nm wide and many micrometers in length — long enough to wind around the circumference of a cell many times.

#### It is possible that hemicelluloses, such as [[xyloglucan]], become trapped in the [[cellulose]] microfibril as it forms, resulting in disordered regions

#### Recent studies indicate that a STEROL GLUCOSIDE might function as the initial acceptor for chain elongation. Sterols are common lipid components of plant cell membranes and sterol-β-glucosides are commonly synthesized in plant plasma membranes, where CESA can use a sterol-glucoside and uridine 5′-diphosphate-glucose to form short sterol-linked glucans

### **Synthesis of matrix polysaccharides**:
#### [[matrix polysaccharide]]s possess a more diverse set of glycosidic linkages and sugar residues

#### CSL proteins contain sequence motifs that are characteristic of β-glycosyltransferases, but lack the N-terminal region containing the zinc-finger domains — which is found in CESA — that function in protein dimerization

#### CSL proteins are considered good candidates for the synthases that are localized in the Golgi and that form the β-DGLYCAN backbone of hemicelluloses such as [[xyloglucan]], xylan, mannan and other β-d-glycans in the cell wall.

### **Forming a network**:
#### [[xyloglucan]] is an abundant [[Hemicellulose]] in [[primary cell wall]], and is believed to crosslink microfibrils, forming either a direct tether between microfibrils or an indirect link

#### Integration of newly secreted [[matrix polysaccharide]] into the existing network might also be mediated by enzymes such as ENDOTRANSGLYCOSYLASES, which cut and ligate glycans together

#### xyloglucan endotransglucosylase (XET), specifically cuts the [[xyloglucan]] backbone and re-forms a glycosidic bond with the free end of another xyloglucan chain (FIG. 4)

^^Hemicelluloses^^ might spontaneously bind to the surfaces of cellulose microfibrils and tether adjacent microfibrils together.
^^Xyloglucan^^ might become entrapped during formation of the ordered microfibril. The untrapped remainder of the xyloglucan would be free to bind to other cellulose surfaces or to other matrix polymers, thereby anchoring the microfibril firmly to its neighbours. This hypothesis might explain why a significant xyloglucan fraction is released from the microfibril only after treatments that cause microfibril swelling (for example, treatment with a strong alkali). It could also explain why a cellulose-specific endoglucanase stimulates cell enlargement: digestion of the noncrystalline region of a cellulose molecule results in the release of the trapped xyloglucan and the microfibril is freed from its tether.
^^Cellulose microfibrils^^ might be simply coated with xyloglucans (blue strands), which adhere to other matrix polysaccharides, without direct linkage between microfibrils (see figure, c). This idea is based on studies showing that the main polysaccharides can be selectively extracted from the growing wall without evidence for covalent linkage 
with other polysaccharide species
^^Xyloglucans^^ (blue strands) might be covalently attached to pectin polysaccharides (red strands), forming a macromolecule that anchors the microfibrils by sticking of xyloglucan to cellulose surfaces (see figure, d). This is a variation of the earliest molecular model of the plant cell wall, which was subsequently dismissed owing to lack of evidence of the covalent linkage between xyloglucan and pectin. However, recent studies report that a proportion of xyloglucan is covalently attached to acidic residues, possibly homogalacturonan. The nature of the hypothetical xyloglucan–pectin linkage has not been 
established.
^^Arabinoxylans^^ (grey strands) might bind cellulose and be crosslinked by ferulic acid esters (A-F-F-A) (see figure, e). This type of phenolic crosslink might also crosslink other hemicelluloses and pectins, particularly in gross cell walls.

## **Discussion**:

## Other Notes:
### It has been postulated that endogenous •OH might be produced nonenzymically by copper ions that are bound to the cell wall or by wall peroxidases from the superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide is formed by monovalent O2 reduction by a plasma-membrane [[NADPH oxidase]] and takes part in various defence responses, as well as in hormone signalling.
