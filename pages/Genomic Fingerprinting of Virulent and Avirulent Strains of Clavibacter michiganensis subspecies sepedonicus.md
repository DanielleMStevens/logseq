- **Abstract**:
	- Genomic fingerprints of [[Clavibacter sepedonicus]] were generated by CHEF gel electrophoresis of restriction digested high-molecular weight DNA.
	- avirulent HR-negative strains clustered separately from virulent HR-positive strains in both EcoRI and HindIII profiles
	- Avirulent HR-positive strains that lack [[pCS1]] clustered with avirulent HR-negative strains in a EcoRI dendogram, but clustered with virulent HRpositive strains in a HindIII dendogram.
- **Introduction**:
	- [[clavibacter]] constitute an uncontested monophyletic cluster possessing B2Î³ type cell wall peptidoglycan with diaminobutyric acid, MK-9 as the major menaquinone, and high [[G+C content]] [2, 3]
	- Although phenotypic variability exists within [[Clavibacter sepedonicus]] previous molecular genetic studies indicate the taxon is genetically uniform.
	- [[Clavibacter sepedonicus]] a single circular plasmid (pCS1) and several copies of a 1.3 kb [repetitive sequence (IS1121)]([[insertion elements]]), which is present on pCS1 and in high copy number in the chromosome [26, 28, 37].
	- Consistent with these findings, the rRNA gene sequences and low-molecular weight RNA profiles of [[Clavibacter sepedonicus]] are also very uniform [17, 32].
- **Results**:
	- **Identification, virulence, and in planta population sizes of C. michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus strains**:
		- all strains except the plasmidless, cellulase-deficient strains P45 and BCP45 were amplified by the pCS1-specific primers of Schneider et al. [38]
		- virulence in eggplant and potato and population sizes in planta
			- ^^Class 1^^, which included CIC243 and Cs3NM, grew poorly in potato, caused none or very slight symptoms in egg-plant and potato, and did not induce the HR in tobacco
			- ^^Class 2^^, which included the cellulase-negative strains BCP45 and P45, grew in potato to a greater extent than class 1 and induced the HR
			- ^^Class 3^^, which included most of the strains and the type strain ATCC33113, caused severe symptoms in eggplant and potato, grew in potato to the greatest extent, and induced the HR
		- Thus the number of bacterial cells needed to produce the same degree of disease severity differed significantly among strains.

	- **Genomic fingerprints of C. michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus strains**:
		- disease class information was overlaid onto the dendograms of genomic fingerprints, several associations became evident
		- Cs3 and CIC242 clustered with each other and were distinguished from other class 3 strains (Fig. 2A)
		- Class 1 strains (avirulent and HR-negative) clustered separately from class 3 strains in both EcoRI and HindIII profiles

- **Discussion**:
	- The genetic similarity values provided by heirarchical analysis of the similarity coefficients were quite high (88%). This finding is completely consistent with previous conclusions that [[Clavibacter sepedonicus]] a monophyletic cluster [2, 3, 17].
	- While these band differences can provide clues into a molecular basis for virulence in [[Clavibacter sepedonicus]], conclusive localization of genes for extracellular polysaccharide production and virulence requires much further study.
	- virulence in [[Clavibacter sepedonicus]] is not strictly correlated with the mucoid phenotype
