- #[[Lab Meeting + Journal Club]]
- Plant Parasitic Nematoeds
	- over 4,000 described
	- root-knot nematdes, wide host range
	- obligate biotophs
	- direct: yield loss, both in quantity and quality
	- indirect: virus vectors, predospose plants to biotic and abiotic stress
- Life style overview:
	- infective stage - J2
	- feeding site -> giant cells (abnormally enlarged, caused by mitosis with no cytokinesis)
	- short life cycle
	- See Siddique and Florian 2018
- Effectors
	- secretion from pharyngeal glands play a vital role for parasitism
		- eh. nematode secreted plant peptide minmic CLE (Clavata3/embryo surrounding region -like) - enhance feedling site
- [[Xanthomonas]] RaxX minimics plant PSY peptide
	- PSY (peptide sulfated on tyrosine)
	- PSY1 sulfated by TyrosylProtein Sulfo Transferase (TPST1)
	- Mature RaxX peptide - similar biological function to plant peptide (At_PSY1)
	- See Pruitt et al., 2017
- Predicted PSY-like peptides in PPNs
	- Potential PSY mimics in RKNs of Meloidogyne incognita group (migPSY) root knot nematodes
	- 50 - 51 AA
	- PSY likke sequencign with a onserved aspartic acid- tyrosine residue
	- is predicted to endcode both MigPSY2 and MigPSY3
- Aim of study:
	- To validate of nematode PSY (MigPSY)
	- Determine the role of MigPSY up on M. javanica-host interaction
- Effectors are expressed early in infection by PCR amplification of cDNA from extracted RNA. (RT-PCR)
- 2-step qPCR - no good amplification of sample
- 1-step qPCR - much better
- Synthetic MigPSY petides promote root growth in Arabidopsis
	- Arabidopsis __tpst-1__ mutants were growht on MS media containing 100 nM of peptides
	- Root length was measured at 9 days after germination
- Evaluation of Xa21 rice line response to M. javanica
	- RaxX minicry and activation of XA21-mediated immunity in Arabidopsis and rice (Pruitt et al., 2017)
- Xa21 rice plants show reduced level of nematide infection
- Ongoing experiments
	- qRT-PCR analysis of MigPSy genes in local nematode infection site
	- Analyzing the role of plant TPST up on nematode infection
