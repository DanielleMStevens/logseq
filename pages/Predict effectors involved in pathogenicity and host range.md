title: Predict effectors involved in pathogenicity and host range
---

## In order to evade immunity, acquire nutrients, and potentially alter metabolism, both pathogens and endophytes secrete effectors (Trda et al., 2015; Rodriguezet al., 2019). 

## I hypothesize that effectors drive the host range observed in the Clavibacter genus.

## For effector prediction, I will classify effectors into three groups: 
### TODO Need to run whole genome through the following programs:
#### TODO SignalP5

#### TODO SignalP4.1

#### TODO Phobius

#### TODO BUSCA

#### TODO dbCan2 

### 

### For effector prediction:
#### Annotation -> SP (2/3+) -> BUSCA (+)
##### dbCan (CAZymes)

##### MEROPS (Proteases)

##### Otherwise 

## I expect gene trees to form monophyletic clades based on the host range of the strain if they  arise from a common ancestor which undergone host adaption. 

## All the above experiments will be interpreted with virulence data. In combination, I anticipate being able to predict effectors associated with pathogenicity across species and species-specific effectors associated with disease on a given host.
