### Synthetic operons were constructed in silico using the __OPTIMIZER__ software (Puigbo et al. [2007](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5350229/#CR21)). A ribosome binding site and linker (5′-AGGAGGAAAAAAAA-3′) was added before each synthetic gene (Kelly et al. [2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5350229/#CR16)) and restriction sites placed at each ends of the gene
