- The neutral model
- Based largely on a brilliant series of papers by Kimura in the 1960s and 70s, the neutral model of evolution has become the standard against which positive selection must be detected. In the neutral model, the vast majority of mutations are divided into two groups. The first group, for which the model is named, is selectively neutral (or nearly neutral) mutations which become fixed in a species by genetic drift. These changes account for almost all the observable nucleotide changes between two species. The second group is selectively deleterious mutations, which arise continuously and are eliminated over time by natural selection. Because these mutations are eventually eliminated from a species, they are rarely observed when comparing the genomes of two species. On the other hand, they are the basis a substantial fraction of population diversity within a species. Because they cause mutant phenotypes, these mutations are well known to functional geneticists, since they account for nearly all of the mutant strains and human diseases that are much studied throughout biology and human health.
- There are many different types of selection that can act on alleles:
-
- Balancing Selection:
	- multiple alleles are actively maintained in the gene pool of a population at frequencies larger than genetic drift alone
- Heterozygous Advantage (overdominance):
	- heterozygous individuals at a particular gene locus has a greater fitness advantage than a homozygous individual
		- ex. sickle cell anemia and malaria
- Frequency-dependent selection:
	- fitness of a phenotype is dependent on its frequency relative to other phenotypes
		- in + case: fitness of a phenotype increases as it becomes more common
		- in - case: fitness of a phenotype decreases as it becomes more common
- Background selection:
	- described the loss of genetic diversity at a non-deleterious locus due to negative selection against linked deleterious alleles
- Disruptive (diverifying) selection:
	- extreme values for a trait are favored over intermediate values
		- variance of a trait increases
	- example outcome: sexual dimorphism (sex differs phenotypically more than just sex organs)
- Directional (positive) selection:
-
- Stabilizing selection
- Fluxuating selection
- Hill-Robertson effects
