- **Abstract**:
	- 4 major problems for bacterial population genetics
		- 1. lack of neutral polymorphisms
		- 2. modeling of promiscuous genetic exchange
		- 3. genetics of 'ill-defined' populations
		- 4. difficulty with untangling selection and demography
	- Other issues with non-random sampling, how to account for pervasive selection and strong genetic linkage

- **Are There Neutral Polymorphisms in Prokaryotes?**:
	- ^^Neutral Mutation-Random Drift Hypothesis^^: at the molecular level most evolutionary change and variability within a species are not caused by [[Darwinian Selection]] but by [[genetic drift]] of mutant alleles that are selectively neutral or nearly neutral
	- mutant alleles are not necessarily neutral but their fate is largely random (i.e. genetic drift)
	- [[2nd Principle of Molecular evolution]]: states that “functionally less important molecules or parts of a molecule evolve faster than more important ones” [(Kimura and Ohta, 1974)]([[On Some Principles Governing Molecular Evolution]]).
	- nonsynonymous mutations are much more numerous and have stronger fitness effects than synonymous mutations
	- fitness effects are usually negative: mutations are gradually purged from populations by natural selection
	- In the absence of strong genetic linkage (an unwise assumption for bacteria, see below), mutations behave neutrally when $$|Ne*s| << 1$$ [(Kimura 1968)](https://www.nature.com/articles/217624a0), where $$Ne$$ is the effective population size and $$s$$ the selection coefficient.
		- large load of deleterious mutations is not necessarily evidence against 
		  the neutral theory if they are quickly purged from populations
	- For more divergent genomes, the ratio rapidly decreases to low values, suggesting that many nonsynonymous mutations have weak negative effects in fitness and remain in populations for a long period of time before being purged by natural selection
	- Obligatory endosymbiotic bacteria endure sexual isolation and frequent population bottlenecks, lowering the efficiency of which natural selection can remove deleterious alleles and as a result, many genes become lost
	- [[Purifying Selection]] leads to low ratois o

	- Ka/Ks is a good indicator of selective pressure at the sequence level, evolutionary change can take place in regulatory regions of a gene, which can affect level, timing, location of gene expression
	- synonymous substitutions can be affected by natural selection (i.e. [[codon usage]] bias), with most mutations being deleterious in bacteria
