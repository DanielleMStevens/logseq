title: nodulation
---

- symbiosis is initated w/ critical signal between host + symbiont
- in low nitrogen conditions, flavanoids secreted from host accumulate
- flavanoid perception method by NodD - products of transcription of bacterial nod genes involved in biosynthesis + secretion of nod factors
- perception of nod factors by plant host triggered by signaling cascade leading to function of infection threads
	- always assess for rhizobbium to enter inner root tissue to form nodeulees to fix nitrogen
- while nod factor recognition contribution to host specificity, differences in NOD-mediated flavanoid induction of nod genes is equally important
	- lack of flavanoid or nod factor production/recognition inhibits nodulation
	- modifications of nod factor componentss (i.e. sulfination, alpha/beta fatty acids) contributes to the ability to perceieve the compound and respond.
- flavanoids from plants impacts host range
	- in legumns, only some contribute to nodulation proccess
- some flavanoids are non-specific nod gene inducers
	- ex. lutecolin aetrosouls NodD in mesorizobia (nodulation in chickpea)
- different flavanoids carbe key for deficient plant-micorbe interactions (i.e. soybean-bradyrhizobiua japon interactions)
- some phytoalexen flavanoids antagenze nod gene induction or are inducers of nod genes, contributing to host raneg
