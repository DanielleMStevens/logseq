## **Abstract**:
### effector protein AvrPhpB (cysteine protease) activates resistance protein RPS5 through cleavage of PBS1

### Claims:
#### Barely contains two PBS1 orthologs

#### AvrPhpB responses maps to a single locus containng NLR repeat

#### Co-expression of PBR1 and AvrPhpB triggers defense responses

### PBR1 (barley) and RPS5 (Arabidopsis) -> similar mechanisms

## **Introduction**:
### PBS1 is a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK) in PTI

### There are 45 RLCKs in Arabidopsis
#### Of which 9 are PBS1-like (AvrPhpB cleaves them)

#### AvrPhpB inhibits FLS2-dependednt PTI (+ EF-Tu triggered defenses)

## **Results**:
### 1. SvrPhoB triggers defense response in barely 
#### Question: why use P. syrinage strain which lacks the T3SS?

### 2. PBS1 homologs in barely (PBR1) contain AvrPhpB recognition site and are cleaved by AvrPhpB
#### Goal: Does barely have defense recognition system similar to arabidopsis RPS1-PBS1 pathway

#### Basian phlogenenic analysis show MLoc_13277 closest related to AtPBS1

#### Further characterization of orthologs show several conserved domains

#### Due to the conservation of the protease cleavage site, AvrPhpB should cleave Barely orthologs

### 3. NLR gene-rich region in barely genome associated with AvrPhpB response
#### orthologs were not located in region identified by GWAS
##### NLR (not PBS1 homolog) is determinant of AvrPhpB

##### Of 13 predicted NLRs, 4 are full length

##### One NLR closely related to RPS5

### 4. PBR1 expressess and allelic variation with phenotype
#### PBR1 - fragmented, likely non-functional

#### GOI2 - > full length

#### GOI2 was very similar to

#### PBR1 single nucleotide inseration in 

#### RT-PCR for expression of PBR1 shows PBR1 is expressed in lines that also showed chlorosis + HR
##### No expression in non-responsive lines

#### GOI2 expression did not correspond with AvrPhpB response

#### Additional sequences from others were conserved: PBR1 grouped by phenotype -> polymorphism determines AvrPhpB response

### 5. PBR1.C (product of PBR1) recognizes AvrPhpB protease activity in Benthi

### 6. PBS1 imunoprecipitates with barely PBR1.c when co-expressed

## **Discussion**:
