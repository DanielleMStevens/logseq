## **Notes**:
### Protein isoforms – proteins that are similar to each other and perform 
similar roles within cells – have played an important role in the 
generation of biological diversity throughout evolution.

### a single gene can encode two or more isoforms by exploiting a process called [[alternative splicing]]]

### two or more closely related genes are responsible for the isoforms.

### At its simplest, isoform generation provides a mechanism to specialize 
the properties of a gene or protein at one of three levels – DNA, 
messenger RNA (mRNA) or the sequence of amino acids in the protein 
itself ([Figure 1](https://elifesciences.org/articles/34477#fig1)).

#### **Differences between β-actin and γ-actin at different levels.**


#### The genes for β-actin (top left) and γ-actin protein (top right) are ^^similar^^ in many ways, as are the ^^mRNAs and proteins they code for^^, but the small differences between them are important. At the level of genes, both ^^intron 3^^ (shown in red for β-actin and orange for γ-actin) ^^and the 3´ untranslated region (3´ UTR) are different^^: moreover, these two elements are conserved features that are found in both birds and mammals. ^^β-actin also has four codons^^ (not shown) ^^that code for four amino acids that are not found in the γ-actin gene or protein^^. (Exons, the regions of DNA that are transcribed to produce mRNA, are shown in pale blue). At the level of mRNA, ^^β-actin has a high density of ribosomes^^ (shown in green), ^^whereas γ-actin has a low density; β-actin also has a sequence (grey) that directs the mRNA molecules to the periphery of the cell^^. At the level of proteins, it has been predicted that β-actin is produced in rapid bursts, whereas γ-actin is produced steadily at a low rate. The essential nature of the differences between β-actin and γ-actin at these three levels is the subject of intensive ongoing research. We thank Yao Wang for preparing this figure.

## β-actin is essential for survival, but γ-actin is not.

## They used genetic tools to edit the four codons that are found in the β-actin gene but not in the γ-actin gene.
### one might have expected the mutant mice to die, but they did not

### there are one or more regions of the nucleotide sequence of the β-actin  
gene – besides the regions that code for the four extra amino acids – 
that have roles that are essential for survival

## unique to the β-actin mRNAs: they have a much higher density of ribosomes than γ-actin mRNAs

## This does not relate to the relative amounts of the two proteins in 
cells, but to a large difference in the capacity of cells to make these 
proteins at any point in time.

## The fact that a cell can produce a large amount of β-actin protein in a 
short burst, whereas it would take a longer time to produce the same 
amount of γ-actin, could be significant.
