- For [[Evolution and Diversity of Known MAMPs in plant-associated Actinobacteria]]
	- Other methods to potentially assess secretion of known MAMPs:
		- Spray or vacuum infiltrate -> collect apoplast fluid -> western
		- ABPP apoplast fluid -> detect proteases?
- Green house problems - see this email [here](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/FMfcgxwJXLkSkLxddWsKDZFSnFWCkNfl)
	- tomato ghouse decontamination

		- Dani and Tanya,
		- Here is a decent article on greenhouse decontamination and different ways to do it. It is important to not have water pooling, so use a flat with holes (but this is probably not your main issue – you have residual pathogens that are hiding out).

		- I have previously used quaternary ammonium chloride salts with good success (Green-Shield, Physan 20, or KleenGrow). All work the same.
		- Hydrogen Dioxide doesn’t work against viruses, but is most effective for fungi/bacteria- but there are more precautions for use.
		- My thoughts would be to order Green-Shield or similar (you can probably get some from Kevin, they must have it for near term use), dilute in a bucket, and scrub the heck out of the entire chamber, doors, walls, benches, etc. Tania can get some rubber gloves, and hand scrubber, scrubber with handle (something like this but I am sure we can get it cheaper/single use):

		- Then clean out quarterly as well as scrub benches between use. This should work and we should try to adopt this as an SOP for all the chambers.
	- Best, Gitta
