## **Abstract**:
### HR4Fei-0 but not the closely related HR4Col-0 protein directly disrupts intramolecular association of RPP7bLerik1-3, which in turn initiates P-loop dependent NLR signaling.
### RPP7bLerik1-3 forms a higher-order complex only in the presence of HR4Fei-0 but not HR4Col-0.
### amyloid-like aggregates, which in turn can directly kill cells in an RPP7bLerik1-3-independent
## **Introduction**:
### Two different interfaces in the TIR domains of SNC1 and RPP1 can support self-association, potentially enabling TNLs to assemble higherorder complexes
### several CNL full-length receptors, such as MLA, Sr33, Sr50, RPS5 and Rx, can self-associate
## **Results**:
## **Discussion**:
