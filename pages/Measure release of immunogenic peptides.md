## Strain - GLC1169 - Rif100

## **Antibodies**
### Mouse monoclonal antibody against E. coli against Ef-Tu (epitope: SKEKFE): https://www.abcam.com/eef1a1ef-tu-antibody-900-ab90813.html
#### But may cross react....? Unlikely...

#### From Microbiology (1 998), 144, 2241-2246:

#### https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/micro/10.1099/00221287-144-8-2241

#### The strongest signal was obtained with the very N-terminal peptide SKEKFERTKPHVNVG. However, the adjacent peptides, lacking either the first two or five N-terminal residues were not detected. This result strongly suggested that the first two N-terminal residues were essential for mAb 900 binding to EF-Tu.

#### Binding was detected by incubation of the membrane with biotinylated anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody (Amersham), diluted 1:lOOO in PBS (001 M NaH,P04/Na,HP04)/1% BSA, for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with avidin horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature.

## **Blotting**:
### Tricine-SDS-PAGE gel protocol: doi:10.1038/nprot.2006.4

### Doing western blog on small peptides (2-3 kDa) is tricky. Try using Bis-Tris (or tris-Tricin) SDS Page gel with a PVDF membrane
#### Bis-Tris Page protocol: https://openwetware.org/wiki/Sauer:bis-Tris_SDS-PAGE,_the_very_best
