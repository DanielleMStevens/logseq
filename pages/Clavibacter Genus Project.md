title: Clavibacter Genus Project

- **Collaborators and Info about their strains**
	- Notes from [[You Lu]] (Carol Ishimaru Lab)
		-
- [[Assess the genetic diversity and evolution of the Clavibacter genus]]:
	- TODO Calculate the percentage of conserved proteins (POCP) in an all-by-all manner
	- TODO Cross compare after adding actinobacteria genomes from other genera.
	- DONE Calculate average nucleotide identity (ANI) in an all-by-all manner
	- TODO create a core gene phylogeny
	- TODO calculate nucleotide diversity (π) for each species from single copy core homologous genes
- [[Predict effectors involved in pathogenicity and host range]]
	- TODO I will identify orthogroups and categorize core, variable, and unique effectors using Get_Homologs (for whole genomes and effectors only)
	- TODO To run Scoary, I need to assess pathogenicity on alternate hosts
		- Host Range of Clavibacter... hmm
	- TODO For all effectors, calculate percent in an ortholog-focused manner.
	- TODO ka/ks test within and across species
	- TODO Tajma’s D will be calculated and compared to neutrally evolving housekeeping genes
	- TODO phylogenetic gene trees for effector homologs
	- TODO Assess syntany of effectors, PAI, and IS elements

- Other:
	- redudacy in CAZymes confers robustness to effectiveness of pathogen
	- endopectase lyases, cleave, polygalacturonate
