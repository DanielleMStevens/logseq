## **Abstract**:
### We used virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) to identify genes playing a role in host basal defense response to C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis infection using Nicotiana benthamiana as a model plant

### screen comprising 160 genes from tomato known to be involved in defense-related signaling ^^identified a set of 14 genes whose suppression led to altered host–pathogen interactions^^

### Disease susceptibility and in planta bacterial population size were enhanced by silencing genes encoding N. benthamiana homologs of ubiquitin activating enzyme, snakin-2, extensin-like protein, divinyl ether synthase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase 2, and Pto-like kinase.

## **Introduction**:
### where it can survive on plant residues up to 3 years

### At present, neither effective resistant tomato cultivars nor effective chemical controls are known. Therefore, disease prevention is mainly through use of pathogen-free certified seed and transplants, and rotation away from tomato for 3 years.

### Researchers also showed that expression of tomato basal defense-related genes, chitinase class II, and pathogenesisrelated (PR) protein-5 isoform ^^was induced only in the absence^^ of the [[chp/tomA]] pathogenicity island (PAI) at early stages of Cm infection, suggesting that PAI-located genes are involved in suppression of tomato basal defenses [(6)]([[Sequential Expression of Bacterial Virulence and Plant Defense Genes During Infection of Tomato with Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis]]).

### Host responses to C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis infection and the molecular mechanisms associated with the development of disease symptoms caused by this pathogen are largely unknown

### Using microarray analysis, we previously identified changes in the expression of 122 tomato genes at 8 days after inoculation with Cm [(2)]([[Tomato Transcriptional Changes in Response to Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis Reveal a Role for Ethylene in Disease Development]]).

### expression of ≈93% of the differentially expressed genes was induced and identities of these genes suggested roles in basal defense for cell wall strengthening, protein degradation, oxidative burst, defenserelated hormones and signaling, transcription factors and many PR proteins (2).
#### These genes include several receptor-like kinases and the putative extracellular glycoproteins ethylene-inducing xylanase (EIX1) (34) and tomato protein Ve1 that confers resistance to Verticillium wilt

### An advantage of VIGS, as previously noted, is the ability to assess function for genes whose mutation (or knockout) might be lethal in sexually propagated plants, or for genes that have functionally redundant family members

### interaction between C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis and N. benthamiana by assessing C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis multiplication and wilt symptom appearance in the silenced plants. The possible functions of six genes identified by VIGS analyses in controlling C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis-induced disease are discussed.

## **Results**:
### **N. benthamiana as a model host for C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis.**
#### Bacterial multiplication was exponential during the first 10 days postinfection and approached saturation at 12 dpi, with the stem tissue colonized with C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis at a titer of $$10^10$$ to $$10^11$$ CFU/g. The experiment was repeated with consistent results (data not shown). Taken together, these results showed that, in our experimental system, initial canker lesions appeared when C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis was in the exponential phase and still multiplying in infected stems, whereas advanced leaf wilting and formation of enlarged cankers was observed when the bacterial titer approached saturation.

### 

## **Discussion**:
### The data reported here clearly indicate that silencing an N. benthamiana ELP enhanced susceptibility to C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis infection and induced early wilting.

### Increased susceptibility to C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis was also evident in plants silenced for UAE and DES. UAE is the first in the multi-enzymatic system that operates ubiquitination, which has been shown to be important in plant defense (30,33
