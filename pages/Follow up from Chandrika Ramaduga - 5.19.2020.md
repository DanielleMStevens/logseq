title: Follow up from Chandrika Ramaduga - 5.19.2020
---

- Erika and I have entered some information in the attached excel table. As soon as the University reopens, we can continue with the PAMP assays at the lab here. I have included
  another column that says if the accession is a host or a non-host. I cannot confidently say that something is a non-host unless we do a controlled experiment in the greenhouse. I will be able to do these tests for some accessions only (the ones that produce seeds and can be evaluated in the greenhouse - after our Riverside BSL3 is set up).
-
- About the correct taxonomy, perhaps we should wait till we are ready to publish and at that time, whatever is publicly available is what we use. Now it is rather confusing to everyone. Basically, all Poncirus, Microcitrus and Eremocitrus will belong to the genus citrus and the species name would be as before. So, Eremocitrus glauca would be Citrus glauca.
-
- We have added three columns to the table. One of them has the CRC number (CRC=citrus research center). Mentioning this is important because other researchers will know exactly which genotype we used and can obtain this genotype from the variety collection if they need to conduct similar experiments. Second column is about HLB host/non-host nature. If the focus of the paper is on response to PAMPs and not on HLB, this can be removed. If we include CLas Csp22 kind of PAMPs, it may become relevant. Third column is about psyllid preference score. This is directly from Westbrook et al paper (Hort Science 46:997-1005). If we are using chitin as one of the PAMPs, the information about psyllid preference may be important. If you think this will distract the reader from the main point we are making about PAMP response, it can be removed. If you think any of these need to be included, we can populate the table and provide this information for all. We can get either CRC number or some other number (for example plant introduction number) to all the taxa included in the study. HLB host/non-host status to some and psyllid preference score to only a few that were evaluated by David Hall’s group (Westbrook’s paper).
-
- We can send some seeds whenever you are ready to receive them.
-
- About adding other genotypes – we now have only one taxon from Toddalioideae – Vepris lanceolata. We have included Zanthoxylum, Ruta (2 species), Esenbeckia from Rutoideae. Some other members of these subfamilies will be available – not from our collection but from UCR campus. On my way to work there is a tree of Calodendrum capense (Cape Chestnut of Rutoideae). But we will not be able to provide a CRC or plant introduction number to this. My identification is based on its morphological features and we can not be sure of its identity. Actually UC Davis has a large number of Rutaceae members on campus. It may be possible to ask the concerned people and get information on these plants and include them in our experiments. I do not know if the reviewers will like that.
-
- Obtaining 3 species for each genus will be difficult. Some of them have only one species available here.
-
- About using common names for figures, I suggest using the botanical names for all citrus relatives (no one will identify them with their common names). For citrus varieties, for example mandarins, instead of the botanical name, we can use the common name. So, the first table in the paper will have a list of botanical names (including new nomenclature that becomes available), common name, CRC number, subfamily, tribe and family.
-
- Subsequent tables will have HLB host/non-host data (if CLas Csp22 data is included), psyllid preference score (when chitin response is included), etc.
-
- Genotypes to include for new MAMP screening: Should we also include a pummelo? A grapefruit? According to Stover and McCollum, Triumph grapefruit is considered tolerant to HLB. Should something like that be included? How many taxa do we want in this group? Is this like a core group of taxa that represent all different subfamilies and tribes of Aurantioideae?
-
- We will gather information on the correct CRC numbers/PI numbers for all the taxa and will send it shortly,
