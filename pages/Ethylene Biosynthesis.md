## Notes from Plant Hormone Signaling, Annual Plant Reviews, Volume 4
Ethylene Biosynthesis and signaling: a puzzle yet to be completed 

## **Introduction**
### important for ripening and impacts many plants at different stages of development including:
#### production is tightly regulated by internal signals and response to environment (abiotic and biotic)

#### - stimulation on germination
- triple response in dark grown dicotyledonous seedlings
-  impairment (most plants) or stimulation (aquatic plants) of cell-expansion

### interesting mutants with defective ethylene signaling produce shortened roots in Arabidopsis

## **Ethylene Biosynthesis**

### 

### Only a portion of AdoMet (S-Adenosylmethioine) is used for the production of ACC (1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid)

### Conversion of ACC into ethylene produces cyanide as a byproduct, which is detoxified to β-cyanoalaniine by β-cyanoalanine synthase to prevent cyanide toxicity

### To exclude some ACC to becoming ethylene, ACC can be conjugated by either MACC (malonylation) or GACC (γ-L-glutamylation)

## 

## highly diffusible - the diffusion coefficient in air is ~10,000x that in water

## Pathway was discovered in 1970s

## 

## **ACC Synthase (ACS)**
### ASCs are encoded by a multigene family with high divergence

### In Arabidopsis, ACS gene family has 12 members with 2 function as only aminotransferases and 2 without proven enzymatic activity

### In vitro assays show large variation in enzymatic efficiencies among [[isoforms]]

## Therefore the levels of AdoMet do not limit the production of ethylen
