title: Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium
---

- Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE): allele and genotype frequencies in a population will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary forces
- **5 Major assumptions to HWE**
	- 1. Random mating
	- 2. Infinite population size
		- No changes in the population generation to generation due to sampling (i.e. no genetic drift)
	- 3. No mutations
	- 4. No migration
	- 5. No natural selection
-
- **Minor assumptions in HWE**
	- Same generations/matting events (non-overlapping generations)
	- Equal allele frequencies in sexes
	- Allele cannot be mitochondrial inherited
	-
- **Equations to model HWE**
	- Genotypic frequencies: $$p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1$$
	- Phenotypic frequencies: $$p + q = 1$$

- **Influences that violate HGE**
	- genetic drift
	- mate choice
	- natural selection
	- sexual selection
	- mutation
	- gene flow: genetic variaiton from on population to another
	- meiotic drive: 1+ loci affect meiotic process such that transmission of said alleles is high (> 50%)
	- genetic hitchhiking: loci near another gene undergoing selective sweeps
	- population bottlenecks: reduced population size due to external events
	- founder effects: loss in genetic variation that occurs when new populations are established by  small number of individuals
	- inbreeding

- **Addition notes:**
	- A good example of Hardy-Weinberg testing in a plant pathogen is for __Phytophthora infestans__ in- and outside of its putative center of origin [(Tooley et. al. 1985).](https://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/disimpactmngmnt/topc/PopGenetics/Pages/references.aspx#Tooley)
