title: Transposable Elements
---

- **Insertion Sequences**
	- central region codes for a transposase
	- at ends: almost perfect inverted-repeat (IR) sequences
	- Not formally part of IS but arise from duplicate at insertion site
		- inspection of DNA region usually shows a further short sequence
		- that is duplicated, but this is in the same orientation (therefore referred to as a direct repeat - DR)
- **Class I elements** - **Retrotransposons**
	- LTR retroelements (long terminal repeat) and non-LTR retroelements
		- **Copy + Paste via:**
			- mRNA transcribed from the element
			- converted into cDNA via reverse transcription
			- where integrase protein integrates into genome
		- ^^Autonomous^^: encodes elements (proteins) necessary for transposition
		  ID:: 48a06de3-a5c0-4ea4-a183-ee58ba07b9d2
		- ^^Nonautonomous^^: require presence of enzymes from intact autonomous elements
- **Class II elements**
	- Superfamilies:
		- hAT (hobo, activator, tam3)
		- CACTA
		- MULE (mutator-like elements)
	- **Copy + Paste via:**
		- physical excision and reintegration into genomes by transposase enzyme
	- ((48a06de3-a5c0-4ea4-a183-ee58ba07b9d2))
	- ^^Nonautonomous^^: minimal sequences necessary for transposition in the presence of functional autonomous elements
- **Helitrons**
	- **Copy + Paste:**
		- instead transposase via 'rolling' circle mechanism
		- single stranded nick at Helitron terminus
		- followed by strand invasion
		- DNA synthesis + strand displacement
		- heteroduplex formation before integration
