title: niche adaptation
---

## This process of â€˜niche adaptation' ^^requires reprogramming of the organism's environmental response networks^^ by reorganizing interactions among diverse parts including environmental sensors, signal transducers, and transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators. Gene duplications have been discovered to be one of the principal strategies in this process, especially for reprogramming of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) [(ref)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038%2Fmsb.2011.87).
