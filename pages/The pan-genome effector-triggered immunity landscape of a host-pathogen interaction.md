## **Tags**: #effectors 

## **Abstract**:
### Effector-triggered immunity (ETI), induced by host immune receptors in response to microbial [[effectors]], protects plants against virulent pathogens.

### We also identified two previously undescribed host immune receptors, including CAR1, which recognizes the conserved [[effectors]] AvrE and HopAA1, and found that 94.7% of strains harbor alleles predicted to be recognized by either CAR1 or ZAR1.

## **Introduction**:
### Given the genotype-specific nature of ETI, it is not clear whether it is ubiquitous and broadly effective against a diverse bacterial pathogen species carrying a dynamic suite of [[effectors]]

### only nine [[Pseudomonas syringae]] effector alleles that elicit ETI through A. thaliana NLRs

### To better understand the frequency of ETI interactions between a host plant and the diverse effector repertoire of a pathogenic species complex

### species-wide diversity of [[effectors]] would uncover novel ETI responses and provide insight into the role of ETI in determining host specificity

## **Results**:
### **the Pseudomonas syringae Type III Effector Compendium (PsyTEC)**:
#### we queried the genome sequences of 494 P. syringae strains isolated from 
more than 100 plant hosts from 28 countries with P. syringae type III 
effector protein sequences assembled from public databases using BLASTP.

#### We delimited these [[effectors]] into 70 homology families and 89 subfamilies using stringent homology criteria

#### we clustered the diversity within each effector family into PsyTEC clades of highly similar sequences using UCLUST with a percent identity cutoff of 95%

#### We constructed PsyTEC by identifying and synthesizing a single representative effector for each multisequence PsyTEC clade on the basis of the following criteria: (i) The effector sequence contained the conserved upstream hrp box promoter sequence within 10 kbp of the start codon, (ii) the effector sequence and upstream region leading up to the hrp box contained no ambiguous bases, and (iii) the effector hrp box and the 25 bp upstream of the hrp box contained no ambiguous bases and did not run into the end of a contig.

#### screen for ETI responses induced by [[effectors]] from both host-adapted and non–host-adapted strains (table S1 and figs. S2 and S3)

### **Widespread recognition of P. syringae effectors by A. thaliana**:
#### We first confirmed that spray inoculation of wild-type [[Pseudomonas syringae]] pv. tomato DC3000 (hereafter PtoDC3000) (17) onto A. thaliana resulted in yellow chlorotic disease symptoms within 7 days, whereas plants 
inoculated with PtoDC3000 expressing the ETI eliciting effector HopZ1a  remained relatively green and healthy

#### Our PsyTEC screen on A. thaliana Col-0 identified 59 ETI-eliciting effector alleles out of the total of 529 effector alleles (11.2%) from 19 of the 70 effector families (27.1%)

#### These data suggest that immune elicitation phenotypes are largely conserved across genetic backgrounds.

#### We assessed what proportion of ETI-eliciting alleles also caused a macroscopic HR, and demonstrated that HR phenotypes were relatively uncommon among ETI-eliciting [[effectors]]

#### The lack of HR phenotypes was not due to effector-effector interactions as no additional HR responses were observed when the 19 ETI-eliciting effector families were screened in the effectorless PtoDC3000 D36E background

#### Interestingly, there was a significant positive association (Student t test, P = 4.6 × 10–23) between the strength of growth reduction and the observation of a visible HR; [[effectors]] that elicited a strong HR caused substantial reductions in growth, whereas those that did not elicit a visible HR caused more modest reductions in bacterial growth

#### The historic reliance of HR phenotypes for identifying ETI-eliciting [[effectors]] likely explains why relatively few of these weak elicitors have been characterized to date.

#### 478 of 494 (96.8%) [[Pseudomonas syringae]] strains harbor at least one highly similar ortholog of an ETI eliciting effector (>95% protein identity), whereas 349 (70.7%) strains harbor multiple orthologs of ETI elicitors

**Figure 1:  Phenotypic effects of ETI-eliciting effectors expressed in PtoDC3000.**(A) Plant disease scores for 529 PsyTEC effectors as determined from percentage of yellow chlorotic plant tissue (22), normalized to the negative (virulent; 100% yellow) and positive (ETI-eliciting; 0% yellow) controls for each flat. A cutoff of 45% yellow (dashed line) was used to distinguish ETI elicitors from non–ETI elicitors. Red dots are alleles that do not elicit ETI; blue dots are alleles that elicit ETI with a hypersensitive response (HR); yellow dots are alleles that elicit ETI without HR. Stars highlight the representatives from each ETI-eliciting family that were used for growth assay verification and NLR screening. (B) Representative ETI-eliciting effectors from each family result in variable declines in bacterial growth in planta over 3 days. Box-and-whisker plots show data from a single representative experiment (n = 8) for each representative ETI-eliciting effector and the corresponding empty-vector control (EV, gray). Solid circles represent individual observations; boxes show the first quartile, median, and third quartile of treatment; whiskers extend to the highest and lowest observations that are not identified as outliers (>1.5× interquartile range). Blue boxes indicate ETI-eliciting effectors producing a macroscopic HR; yellow boxes indicate effectors that did not show HR. All effectors significantly reduced bacterial growth (Student t tests with Holm-Bonferroni multiple test correction, P < 0.01). Plant images show representative HR results and the total number of HR responses observed out of 60 leaves assayed. (C) ETI-eliciting effectors producing a macroscopic HR (blue) resulted in significant reductions in bacterial growth relative to those that did not elicit HR (yellow). P = 4.6 × 10–23 (Student t test).

## 
### Note that these predictions of ETI prevalence are made on the basis of the presence of an ETI eliciting effector or its ortholog (ETI potential) and that the actual outcome of an interaction could be influenced by three potential variables: 
#### (i) Meta-effector interactions within a specific strain may modulate ETI responses and the outcome of the interaction. 
(ii) Chromosomally expressed [[effectors]] may not have the same ETI-eliciting activity as [[effectors]] expressed from plasmids. This appears to be the case for at least some AvrE [[effectors]]; however, even if we exclude all AvrE [[effectors]] from our analysis, we still see that 78.8% of primary phylogroup strains harbor an ETI eliciting effector. 
(iii) There is as much as 5% amino acid divergence within each PsyTEC clade (technically, up to 95% identity to the cluster seed for each clade), and some of this diversity may result in differential ETI outcomes.

## 
### **A. thaliana resistance to P. syringae is conferred by a small number of NLRs**:
#### The number of ZAR1 dependent ETI responses identified in the screen was also notable in that we identified novel ZAR1-dependent ETI responses against the HopO, HopX, and HopBA families, in addition to the previously characterized ZAR1 dependent ETI responses against HopZ1a

#### ETI response against each P. syringae strain from that strain’s complement of putative ETI-eliciting [[effectors]] and then mapped these “resistance NLRs” across the phylogeny

## 
### **A single ETI response can determine host accessibility**:
#### Finally, we tested whether an individual NLR can limit the ability of [[Pseudomonas syringae]] strains to grow on A. thaliana based on the presence of their cognate [[effectors]].

#### We observed that the strong A. thaliana pathogen PmaES4326 and the closely related strain (based on the core genome phylogeny) [[Pseudomonas syringae]] pv. maculicola YM7930 (PmaYM7930; also radish pathogen) differed in their suites of ETI eliciting effector profiles by only the presence of HopAR1 in PmaYM7930

#### We hypothesized that the presence of HopAR1 in PmaYM7930, which is recognized by A. thaliana NLR RPS5 (ETI can determine host accessibility)

**Figure 4: ETI governs host specificity on A. thaliana.** The P. syringae isolate PmaYM7930 harbors one additional ETI-eliciting effector (HopAR1, which induces ETI via the RPS5 NLR) that is not present in the closely related and highly virulent strain PmaES4326. (A) Visual symptoms of representative wild-type Col-0 and rps5 mutant plants sprayed with PmaYM7930 compared to Col-0 sprayed with PmaES4326 using a standard no-flash setting. (B) Same photos as in (A) but with a green-pass filter to enhance the difference between diseased and healthy tissue. (C and D) In planta bacterial growth assays (C) and plant disease scores based on the proportion of yellow chlorotic plant tissue (D) illustrate that the recognition of HopAR1 by RPS5 significantly reduces bacterial growth and disease symptoms. Letters above bars represent significance groups at P < 0.05 (Student t tests with Holm-Bonferroni multiple test correction).

#### 

#### a single NLR-effector interaction has the potential to change the outcome of a specific host pathogen interaction, but this may not be sufficient to determine host accessibility.

## **Discussion**:
### Because of the prominence of ETI against [[Pseudomonas syringae]], we hypothesize that ETI avoidance will be a crucial virulence strategy of successful pathogens, involving the loss and/or modification of ETI-eliciting 
[[effectors]]

### meta-effector interactions will also modulate ETI responses, as shown by the loss of recognition of three [[effectors]] when expressed in the PmaES4326 background and the well-established interactions between AvrRpt2 and AvrRpm1

### Finally, as demonstrated by the differential recognition of AvrE when encoded chromosomally versus on a plasmid (see fig. S12), we hypothesize that effector dosage must be regulated to maximize virulence benefits while avoiding host detection.
