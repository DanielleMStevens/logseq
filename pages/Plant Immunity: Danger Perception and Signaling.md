## **Abstract**:
### Here we highlight recent advances in understanding the mechanisms underlying activation of the main classes of immune receptors, summarize the current understanding of their signaling mechanisms, and discuss an updated model for SA perception and signaling

## **Introduction**:
### Unlike commensal or beneficial microbes, pathogenic microbes can not only deprive nutrients but also perturb physiological processes, arrest growth, and inflict tissue damage to their hosts via production of toxins, cell-wall-degrading enzymes, and virulence proteins

### Cell-surface immune receptors consists of receptor-like proteins (RLPs) and receptor kinases (RKs)

### In addition, we discuss how different immune receptors form surveillance networks to integrate different immunogenic signals that could be the key to interpret threat of pathogen attacks for effective defenses.

## **Immunogenic Signals and Microbial Recognition**:
### Plants use lytic enzymes to facilitate the release of MAMP epitopes from invading pathogens such as bacterial flagellin epitope [[flg22]] and [[peptidylglycan]]

### pathogens can inflict damage to plant tissues via cell-wall-degrading enzymes and toxins releasing plant cell wall fragments, extracellular ATP, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)

### Furthermore, altered cell wall integrity is also actively monitored by plants and likely contributes to pathogen sensing

### phytocytokines that are perceived by [[PRRs]] or PRR-associated receptors to modulate immune responses in a way analogous to cytokines in animal immunity

### plant elicitor peptides ([[Peps]]) are prominent phytocytokines that trigger defenses through the leucine-rich repeat RKs (LRR-RKs) PEPR1 and PEPR2

### Multiple cytoplasmic type-II metacaspapses (MCs) control the cleavage and maturationand release of Peps into the [[apoplast]]

### Plants additionally use various [[apoplastic proteases]] to control the maturation of peptide
#### SA-inducing peptide Zip1 in maize

### host-pathogen co-evolution can render these pathogen [[effectors]] immunogenic when the host plant acquires cognate immune receptors

## **Discussion**:
