## **Notes**:
### In 2014, natural infections of a limited number of tomato plants due to C. sepedonicus were reported in Belgium (Van Vaerenbergh et al., 2016)

### C. sepedonicus may persist (after inoculation) in maize, bush bean, broad bean, oilseed rape and pea as well as weeds commonly found in potato ﬁelds (Van der Wolf et al., 2005a, 2005b)

### Sugar beet has been described as a natural asymptomatic host of C. 
sepedonicus. Indeed, colonies of C. sepedonicus were isolated from 
asymptomatic sugar beet seeds produced in ﬁelds in Oregon, USA. 
#### The C. sepedonicus strains were pathogenic on potatoes but did not consistently induce symptoms on sugar beet after inoculation (Bugbee and Gudmestad, 1988).
