- **Abstract**:
	- 23 strains of coryneform bacteria: 17 cause ratoon stunting disease of sugarcane & 6 cause bermudagrass stunting disease
	- cell wall composition analysis: contains 2,4-diaminobutyric acid with rhamnose and fucose
	- polysaccharide gel analysis shows similar patterns to Corynebacterium Clavibacter michiganensis
- **Introduction**:
	- Disease originally thought to be due to virus; microscopy of healthy and sick sugarcane showed otherwise
	- two diseases are pathologically distinct: including symptoms in its natural hosts but not in the natural host of the other bacterium; both bacteria are capable of multiplying in xylem vessel of both hosts
	- ratoon stunting agent is transmissible to several graminaceous host, which remain symptomless
	- all are gram-positive, non-spore forming, non-acid fast
- **Results**:
	- neither strain was flagellated, nor was motility observed in agar or broth
	- optimal growth temperature: 23-30C
	- G+C content: ratoon stunting strains L1A & B1B ~ 66%
	- diaminobutyric acid, glutamic acid, alanine, and glycine present in the cell wall
- **Discussion**:
	- Saprophytic coryneform bacteria with similar cell wall composition: Clavibacter genus
		- Corynebacterium michiganensis subsp. michiganensis: Smith 1910
		- Corynebacterium michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis: Schuster 1973
		- Corynebacterium michiganensis subsp. insidiosus: McCulloch 1925
		- Corynebacterium michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus: Spieckermann and Kotthoff 1914
		- Corynebacterium michiganensis subsp. tessellarius Carlson and Vidaver 1982
	- gram-positive, non-acid fast, pleomorphic rods which are often arranged in 'v'
	- endospores do not form, non-motile, obligately aerobic
	- major amounts of rhamnnose but not arabinose found in the cell wall
		- does not have mycolic acids
	- non-hydroxylated fatty acids consist of mostly anteiso- and iso-methyl branched chains; minor amounts of straight-chained saturated acids
