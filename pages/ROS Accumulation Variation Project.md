title: ROS Accumulation Variation Project
---

- **Questions Related to Project**:
	- 1. What is the degree of variability for a given MAMP across diverse plant speices?
	- 2. Is this variability driven by plant genetics? Is it driven by the environment? Or both to some degree?
	- 3. Is ROS response correlated with disease suseptibilty?
	- 4. Is this unique to Citrus?
	-
- **To-Do:**
	- ~~Modify main heatmap to add asktricks to variable samples~~
	- ~~Make correlation plots instead of heatmaps (X axis -> increasing disease suseptibilty, Y- axis -> increaseing ROS burst)~~
	- update data with chandrikas info and assess differences in ROS response variability of field vs. greenhouse samples
	- ~~figure out the right statistical test (maybe?) to assess the correlation between ROS response and disease suseptibilty?~~
	- Gather and plot data from [this paper](https://www.readcube.com/library/95fd6ff6-fca1-4a81-9ddb-c57079c1e1f2:3f817bb1-bd8a-40cd-8c85-be5f490e3be9) to see if there is a difference in trends between Citrus and Tomato

	- update onenote
	- use Lavene's test to assess the homogeneity of variance
