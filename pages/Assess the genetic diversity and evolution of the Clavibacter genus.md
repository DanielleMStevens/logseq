title: Assess the genetic diversity and evolution of the Clavibacter genus
---

- To assess if some pathogens are under different selective pressure and thus, have diverged in respect to their co-evolution with a given host,I want to first assess the evolution of the species across the Clavibacter genus. I hypothesize that species have diverged recently but  within a species, are predominantly clonal.
-
- I expect the number clades to approximately equal the number of species predicted via ANI based on an approximate cutoff of ~94%.
- I expect for species which have not undergone repeated outbreaks, genetic diversity within a species would be low and will be higher for species which have experienced repeated outbreak events.
- However, I still expect these values to low compared to other pathogens as the emergence of Clavibacter pathogens has only been documented in about the last 100 years (Davis et al., 1984). This population statistics will provide an assessment of clonality within a given species and the diversity across species (Sheppardet al., 2018).
