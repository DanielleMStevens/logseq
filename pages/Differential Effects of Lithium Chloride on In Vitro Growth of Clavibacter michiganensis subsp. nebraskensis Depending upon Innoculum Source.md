- **Abstract**:
	- In broth culture: colony numbers was the same for NBY (rich medium) versus CNS (semi-selective medium)
	- Cells isolated from infected plant tissue: very few colonies recovered on CNS
	- With omission of lithium chloride, colony counts from CNS were nearly the same as NBY
- **Introduction**:
	- All Clavibacter nebraskensis used was orginally isolated from infected corn grown in Nebraskia
	- Corn cultivars used:
		- {{table}}
			- Hybrid A619XA632
				- Dent Corn
					- Highly Suseptible
			- Hybrid Mo17XB73
				- Dent Corn
					- Considered Resistent
			- Golden Cross Bantam
				- Sweet Corn
					- Highly Suseptible
	- the addition of LiCl was probably for the purpose of inhibiting gram-negative bacterial growth without affecting [[Clavibacter nebraskensis]] growth
	-
- **Results**:
	- LiCi had strongest inhibitory effects against CN72-2 cells reisolated from corn
	- inhibition of organism on [[CNS]] was eliminated by omitting LiCl
		- remaining inhibitory effect was likely due to polymyxin B sulfate & malidixic acid
	- conclusions on impact of recovery by LiCl comparable in artificial and natural infections
