## Spearman rank-order correlation
### The Spearman correlation evaluates the monotonic relationship between two continuous or ordinal variables. In a monotonic relationship, the variables tend to change together, but not 
necessarily at a constant rate. The Spearman correlation coefficient is based on the ranked values for each variable rather than the raw data.

### Spearman correlation is often used to evaluate relationships involving ordinal variables. For example, you might use a Spearman correlation to evaluate whether the order in which employees complete a test exercise is related to the number of months they have been employed.
