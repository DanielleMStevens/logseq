## 

## **For Predoctoral Fellowships and Postdoctoral Fellowships, Project Narrative Attachment must include all of the following:**
### **a) Training/Career Development Plan**
#### The Training/Career Development Plan is a description of all activities that the applicant plans to perform and participate in which will enhance the pre- or postdoctoral training during the fellowship award period. For Predoctoral Fellowship applicants, this plan must include
##### personal statement addressing future career directions or preparation for entering the workforce

##### overall career goals and objectives, as well as how, if awarded, the fellowship will allow them to accomplish their professional goals and objectives

##### any other training objectives

##### any extension and educational activities (e.g., teaching in formal or informal settings) to enhance their career development that will be undertaken during their doctoral training

### **b)   Mentoring Plan**
#### The applicants are expected to identify a Primary mentor who will be willing to help them in their application and projects as well as professional development (more than one Primary Mentor is acceptable for Integrated Projects Only). If there are other collaborating mentors, their role and responsibilities to the project and development of the applicant’s skills should be clearly described. For predoctoral applications, if the primary mentor is not the student’s graduate advisor or laboratory sponsor, the relationship between advisor’s work and the primary mentor’s research should be clearly defined, and the contribution of each individual in the student’s project as well as degree completion should be included. The commitment of the mentor(s) is included in the evaluation criteria as it pertains to project personnel.^^ In describing the role of the mentor, the applicant should:^^
##### 1) Briefly indicate how the mentoring and educational training will add to the skill sets of the NIFA Fellow

##### 2) Briefly explain the commitment of the primary mentor

##### 3) Briefly describe the role of collaborating mentors (if applicable)

##### 4) With respect to the Primary Mentor, provide a list of former mentees and their current positions.
###### NOTE: The Primary Mentor shall submit a Letter of Commitment (as an attachment to Field 12, Other Attachments, of the Other Project Information form) explicitly indicating their respective responsibilities throughout the proposed project in relation to the Project Director.

##### 5) Briefly list and explain the role of other non-primary mentors

### **c)   Project Plan**
#### Predoctoral Applicants: It is expected that predoctoral students will be working with a primary mentor or advisor who has funded research and that the fellow may work on another aspect of this research. Moreover, the mentor/advisor will already have the facilities, equipment, technologies and methodologies for the projects developed with the fellow. Experimental methods, especially if these are routinely or generally used, do not need detailed description. However,^^ sufficient details on the experimental approach^^ or strategy ^^as well as pitfalls must be provided ^^to allow assessment of feasibility of study. The Project scope should be within the 3-year timeframe of the fellowship.
