## **Abstract**:
### Xylem colonizing pathogens
#### - [[Xanthomonas campestris]] pv. campesteris
- Erwinia amylovora
- Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii
- [[Clavibacter michiganensis]] and other [[clavibacter]] species,
- [[Pseudomonas syringae]] pv. actinidiae,
- [[Xylella fastidiosa]]

### Noticeably, only a relatively small number of resistant cultivars in major crop against these vascular bacterial pathogens except X. oryzae pv. oryzae have been found or generated so far

### we propose infection processes of xylem-colonizing bacterial pathogens as one of possible reasons for why so few qualitative disease resistance genes against these pathogens have been developed or identified so far in crops

## **Introduction**:
### Mature xylem tissues are composed of three main cell types: tracheary elements (tracheids and vessels), fibers, and [[parenchyma cells]] [(Schuetz et al. 2013)]([[Xylem tissue specification, patterning, and differentiation mechanisms]])

### small number of resistant cultivars against the xylem-colonizing bacterial pathogens listed above have been found or generated so far

### The first two cell types are not metabolically active and form xylem 
pores for water movement, while [[parenchyma cells]] are metabolically active and exist outside of xylem vessels. 

### Xylem vessels are connected with one another through pits, and their size is the first barrier for passage of bacterial cells through pit membranes [(Perez-Donoso et al. 2010)]([[]]).

## **Possible infection processes of major xylem‑colonizing bacterial pathogens**:
### [[Xanthomonas]] oryzae pv. oryzae:
#### [[Gram-negative pathogens]] causing bacterial leaf blight in rice

#### enters leaf tissues mainly through the [[hydathodes]] at the leaf margin

#### it then multiples in the intercellular spaces of the epitheme, which is made of thin-walled parenchyma tissue

### [[Xanthomonas campestris]] pv. campestris:
#### [[Gram-negative pathogens]] causing black rot disease in cruciferous plants

#### Also initially infects leaves through the [[hydathodes]] in the leaf margin

#### V-shaped necrotic lesions surrounded by chlorotic lesions appear at the infected sites

#### Infection to the vascular systems causes another symptom, which is blackening of the vascular tissues

### [[Ralstonia solanacearum]]:
#### [[Gram-negative pathogens]] causes bacterial wilt disease in diverse plant species including tomato, pepper, and potato

#### It can survive in the soil for a long time in an inactive state

#### initially infects the roots at two different sites: the zone of elongation where plant exudation occurs and at the axils of emerging or developed secondary roots

### [[Clavibacter michiganensis]]:
#### Gram-positive pathogen causes bacterial canker in tomato

#### eventually enters into xylem vessels and colonizes the walls of xylem vessels

#### particular, cell wall-degrading enzymes such as cellulase, polygalacturonase, pectin methylesterase, and xylanase are known to be produced and degrade cell walls of xylem vessels, allowing bacteria to attack the adjacent [[parenchyma cells]]

#### primary paths used by the bacterium to reach the xylem vessels are mostly unknown, although they begin to infect host plants through wounds of the stem

## **Disease resistance conferred by qualitative R gene against xylem‑colonizing bacterial pathogens**:
### Bacterial flagellin, peptidoglycan, lipopolysaccharide, and elongation factor are well-known [[MAMPs]]

### R genes such as Pto and Rsb (for ‘resistance suppressed by AvrPtoB C-terminus’) together with Prf are effective to [[Pseudomonas syringae]] pv. tomato causing bacterial speck in tomato leaves

### R genes such as Bs genes (Bs1 ~ Bs4) are effective to [[Xanthomonas campestris]] pv. vesicatoria causing bacterial spot disease in tomato and pepper leaves

### In contrast to bacterial pathogens mostly infecting leaves, however, among eight xylem-colonizing bacterial pathogens (Table 1), R genes only responsible for the recognition of corresponding [[effectors]] from [[Ralstonia solanacearum]] and [[Xanthomonas]] oryzae pv. oryzae have been characterized in Arabidopsis and rice, respectively.

### 37 R genes (Xa genes) have been characterized in diverse rice
#### Twenty-one R genes have been characterized as dominant or semi-dominant genes, while eight genes are recessive

#### In silico analyses indicate that some of cloned Xa genes such as 
Xa3/Xa26 and Xa27 genes are highly expressed in the leaf blade of rice 
where infection of X. oryzae pv. oryzae is initiated

### [[Ralstonia solanacearum]] produces at least 94 Ralstonia injected proteins (Rip), including 22 known effector proteins
#### PopP2 is a sole effector that has a characterized corresponding R protein, RRS1-R, in Arabidopsis, and recognition of PopP2 by RRS1-R induces ETI

#### RRS1-R gene is an allele of RRS1-S seen in other Arabidopsis ecotypes 
and is expressed in all tissues of Arabidopsis, based on in silico analysis

### there is no genetic evidence that any R genes responsible for resistance to other five vascular pathogens

### use of alternate infection paths and mechanisms by xylem-colonizing 
bacteria to enter into xylem vessels unlike X. oryzae pv. oryzae and 
leaf pathogens would be one of plausible reasons that will be discussed 
below

## **Disease resistance conferred by QTLs against xylem‑colonizing bacterial pathogens**:
### So far, QTLs responsible for resistance to seven of the xylem-colonizing bacterial pathogens mentioned above, except Pseudomonas syringae pv. 
actinidiae causing bacterial canker in kiwifruit, have been identified (Table 1).
#### Two QTLs, Rcm 2.0 and Rcm 5.1, against the bacterium [[Clavibacter michiganensis]] subsp. michiganensis were identified only in wild tomato species, Solanum habrochaites (previously Lycopersicon hirsutum) (Coaker and Francis 2004)

## **Possible reasons that only of few R genes against xylem‑colonizing bacteria have been identified in crops**:
### it would be expected to first colonize the epitheme, which is composed of a group of metabolically active cells.

### Similarly, [[Xanthomonas campestris]] pv. campestris also infects through [[hydathodes]] and should colonize epitheme.
#### this pathogen kills host cells probably by degrading cell walls based on
 the rotting symptom observed. Indeed, this bacterium produces two 
polygalacturonases that are important for virulence

### suggests that epitheme cells may be destroyed so rapidly that any R gene 
expression is ineffective or any effective R genes do not exist.

### [[CAZymes]] could trigger innate immunity in rice, but bacterial [[effectors]] could actively suppress it

### Consistently, [[Xylella fastidiosa]] and [[Clavibacter michiganensis]] does not possess a Hrp type III secretion system

### In [[Clavibacter michiganensis]], it has been shown that the bacterium colonizes xylem vessels and is transmitted by seeds

### only two QTLs, but no R genes, have been identified for this pathogen,
 indicating that host cells may not have the opportunity to evolve R genes
