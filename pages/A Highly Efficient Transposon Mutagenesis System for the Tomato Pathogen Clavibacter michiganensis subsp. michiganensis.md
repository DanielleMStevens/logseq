- **Abstract**:
	- A transposon mutagenesis system for Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis was developed based on antibiotic resistance transposons that were derived from the insertion element IS1409 from Arthrobacter sp. strain TM1 NCIB12013
	- Analysis of Tn1409C insertion sites suggests a random mode of transposition. Transposition of Tn1409C was also demonstrated for other subspecies of C. michiganensis.
- **Introduction**:
	- To be able to identify other pathogenicity-related genes that are located on the chromosome, an efficient system for mutagenesis would be beneficial
	- IS (insertion sequence) element IS1409 from the actinomycete Arthrobacter sp. strain TM1 NCIB12013 and the construction of a family of artificial transposons
	- previously published procedure (Meletzus et al. 2000) yielded only between 0 and 5 transposon mutants per Âµg of vector DNA, which requires a tremendous effort to obtain a specific mutant
- **Results**:
- **Discussion**:
