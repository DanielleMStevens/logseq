title: Understanding Genetic Variation
---

- **Question**
	- Is there an association between DNA sequences variation and the disease phenotype?
	- How has natural selection shaped diversity in the gene?
- **The AIMS of population genetics**
	- To understand the link between genetic variation and phenotypic variation
		- Is variation at this gene associated with disease susceptibility?
	- To investigate the evolutionary history of a species
		- How long have these population been separate?
		- Which genes have experienced recent adaptive evolution?
	- To learn about fundamental biological process
		- How does the recombination rate vary along the genome?
	- Different kinds of genetic variation exists
		- SNPs, recombination, partially linked vs. unlinked markers, single gene, multigene, whole genome
- **How do we make sense of data**
	- Nonparametric methods: don't rely on model (i.e. parsimony)
	- Parametric methods: explicitly state the model (i.e. likelihood)
