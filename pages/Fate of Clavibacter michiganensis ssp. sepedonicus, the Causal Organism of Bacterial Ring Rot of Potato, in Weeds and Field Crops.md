- **Abstract**:
- **Introduction**:
- **Results**:
	- When cell viability was checked by IFC, the bacteria were present only 
	  in ﬁve of nine crops tested, namely maize, bush bean, broad bean, rape 
	  and pea, and then, in lower numbers (<$$10^2$$–$$10^3$$ cells/g of tissue)
	- The persistence of wild-type Cms strain 4053 in roots of maize, wheat, 
	  broad bean and rape 8 weeks after inoculation was indicated by the high 
	  proportion of replicate root samples of all crop plants tested which 
	  were both IF-positive and IFC-positive.
- **Discussion**:
