- **Abstract**:
	- The horizontal acquisition of functional plant-like expansin genes in numerous xylem-colonizing phytopathogenic bacteria suggests that bacterial expansins may also contribute to virulence
	- non-chimeric [[expansin]] genes (CmEXLX2 and RsEXLX) of two xylem-inhabiting bacterial pathogens
	- Cmm ΔCmEXLX2 mutant caused increased symptom development on tomato, 
	  which was characterized by more rapid wilting, greater vascular necrosis and abundant atypical lesions on distant petiole
	- Rs ΔRsEXLX mutant showed reduced virulence on tomato following root 
	  inoculation, but not following direct petiole inoculation, suggesting 
	  that the RsEXLX expansin contributes to early virulence at the root 
	  infection stage
- **Introduction**:
	- The regulation of cell wall elasticity and plasticity is an intricate process that requires many cell wall-loosening enzymes, including expansins (Cosgrove, 1993; Sampedro and Cosgrove, 2005)
	- [[expansin]]s are pH dependent and are activated when plant growth hormones stimulate H1-ATPases, which lower the pH of the cell wall matrix by  producing a proton differential across the plasma membrane
	- [[expansin]]s are rare in bacteria; only 3% of sequenced bacteria have expansin [[xenologues]], and these bacterial genera represent diverse ecological niches from free-living saprophytes to plant pathogens (Nikolaidis et al., 2014).
	- Interestingly, systemic xylem pathogens are present in all plant-pathogenic genera with an expansin gene: [[Xanthomonas]], [[Xylella fastidiosa]], [[Ralstonia solanacearum]], Dickeya, Pectobacterium, Acidovorax and Clavibacter (Georgelis et al., 2015; Nikolaidis et al., 2014)
	- The only exception is the genus [[Streptomyces]] (Nikolaidis et al., 2014).
	- However, no expansin xenologues are present amongst the nonvascular phytopathogenic bacterial genera Pseudomonas or [[Agrobacterium]] (Nikolaidis et al., 2014)
	- [[Xylella fastidiosa]] and [[Clavibacter michiganensis]] mutants lacking the endoglucanase-expansin chimeras cause reduced disease symptoms (Ingel et al., 2015; Jahr et al., 2000).

- **Results**:
	- CmEXLX2 was disrupted in a virulent Cmm New York strain (Cmm0317) that naturally lacked the CmEXLX1 plasmid-borne chimeric expansin (Tancos et al., 2015)
	- **The Cmm ΔCmEXLX2 mutant causes increased symptoms on tomato seedlings and fruit**:
		- Tomato seedlings inoculated with ΔCmEXLX2 consistently developed earlier and more severe wilt symptoms than the wild-type or complemented strains
		- All three Cmm strains produced typical stem cankers at the site of inoculation, but ΔCmEXLX2 also produced multiple atypical cankers in the vascular bundles of distant petioles that appeared at approximately 11–14 DPI (Table 1, Fig. 1).

		- necrosis was confined to the vasculature, with healthy tissue surrounding the lesions until the later stages of disease development (Fig. 1)
		- All three Cmm strains were detectable 5 and 10 cm above the site of inoculation
		- the population sizes of the two strains were not different 10 cm above the inoculation site (P 5 0.46) (Table S1A).
		- Cmm wild-type (CmEXLX21) and ΔCmEXLX2 strains were both visible in xylem vessels at 3 cm above and below the inoculation site at 5, 7 and 9 DPI
		- no detectable differences in lateral movement or [[parenchyma cells]] colonization between the strains at any time point or distance from the inoculation site
		- visible in macerated vessel elements and in the surrounding [[parenchyma cells]] (Table S2B and Fig. S5, see Supporting Information)
	- **Symptom development on tomato seedlings infected with the Rs ΔRsEXLX mutant**:
		- A soil drench inoculation of unwounded plants mimics the natural route of Rs infection, whereas the cut petiole technique bypasses root infection by introducing Rs directly into the xylem
		- . By 14 DPI, only 56% of plants inoculated with ΔRsEXLX displayed symptoms, compared with 87% and 89% of plants inoculated with the wild-type and complemented mutant strains, respectively
	- **Heterologous expression of Rs expansin in Cmm**:
		- we tested whether the heterologous expression of RsEXLX could complement the hypervirulence of ΔCmEXLX2
		- this hybrid fusion strain was named CΔCmP:RsEXLX1
		- The [[expansin]]-hybrid did not restore the Cmm wild-type-level virulence and canker severity when inoculated into tomato, but showed a tendency to induce less severe disease than ΔCmEXLX2

		  **Fig. 9S: The mean area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) for the disease severity of Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. michiganensis.** Cmm017 (wild-type), DCmEXLX2 (Cmm expansin mutant), CDCmEXLX2+ (Cmm complement), and CDCmP:RsEXLX+ (Ralstonia solanacearum expansin-hybrid mutant) on tomato. Differences among strains were determined using he lme4 package in Rv3.3.2 to create a linear mixed effects model (P < 0.05) followed by Tukey-Kramer post-test (P < 0.05). AUDPC values with the same letter are not significantly different. Three independent experiments are presented. Error bars correspond to the standard error.
		- Although both CmEXLX2 and RsEXLX are nonchimeric [[expansin]]s, they only share 27% amino acid identity, which could explain why RsEXLX did not restore wild-type-level virulence (Table 2 and Fig. S10, see Supporting  Information).

- **Discussion**:
	- only ΔCmEXLX2 caused atypical necrotic lesions on the vasculature of distant petioles
	- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FQualifying_Exam%2F_cTEwt0Hug.png?alt=media&token=3a572529-621a-464c-b3c7-1a9fb3dfb139)
	- We favour the hypothesis that CmEXLX2 competes with the numerous Cmm cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs) for unique binding sites on the plant cell wall, which may have increased efficiency, resulting in major structural changes and the breakdown of the plant cell wall (i.e. necrosis)
	- increased necrosis caused by ΔCmEXLX2 probably poses a fitness cost at another life cycle stage, such as during seed or leaf infection
	- hypervirulent in grape, but are poorly transmitted by their insect vectors because they attach too strongly to host surfaces (Newman et al., 2004)
	- Previous studies have shown that disruption of the endoglucanase-expansin chimeras in Cmm and [[Xylella fastidiosa]] reduces disease symptoms (Ingel et al., 2015; Jahr et al., 2000; Laine et al., 2000).
	- Streptomyces also contains non-vascular phytopathogenic bacteria possessing bacterial expansins; however, some phytopathogenic Streptomyces sp., such as S. acidiscabies, can tolerate acidic soils with pH values ranging between 4 and 5.5, depending on the strain (Lambert and Loria, 1989a,b).
