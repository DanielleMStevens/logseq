## **Abstract**:
### hydrolase CbsA acts as a phenotypic switch between vascular and non vascular plant pathogenesis

### cbsA was enriched in genomes of vascular phytopathogenic bacteria in the Xanthomonadaceae family and absent in most non-vascular species

### CbsA expression allowed non-vascular Xanthomonas to cause vascular blight

### gain and loss of single loci can facilitate the evolution of complex ecological traits

## **Introduction**:
### Complex structural and biochemical differences between vascular and non-vascular tissues suggest that pathogens have multiple distinct adaptations to either environment, yet the genetic and evolutionary bases of such adaptations are largely unknown

### In bacteria, gene gain occurs primarily through [[Horizontal Gene Transfer]] while gene loss or pseudogenization occurs through multiple mechanisms, including transposon-mediated insertions and sequence deletions in open reading frames

### gene gain and loss effectively act as phenotypic switches, enabling rapid shifts between what otherwise seem like complex lifestyles

### gain and loss of [genomic islands]([[pathogenicity island]]) containing multiple genes all contributing to the same phenotype

### vascular xylem and non-vascular [[parenchyma cells]] represent distinct niches
#### Xylem is comprised of dead cells with highly reinforced walls organized into cylinders that provide plants with structural integrity and a means of long-distance fluid transport

#### [[parenchyma cells]] are composed of living cells and gas filled intercellular spaces

### Xylem tissue runs throughout the plant, enabling the distribution of water from roots to leaves, but also serving as a potential pathway for rapid, systemic transport of pathogens

### [[Xanthomonas]] (Gammaproteobacteria) is diverse genus of plant-associated 
[[Gram-negative bacteria]] that cause vascular and non-vascular diseases of over 200 monocot and dicot plant hosts

### [[Xanthomonas]] species are separated into subgroups called pathovars (pv.) based on their phenotypic behavior such as symptom development (e.g. vascular or non-vascular) or host range

### the genetic determinants distinguishing vascular from non-vascular Xanthomonas lineages at the intraspecific level are not clear.

## **Results**:
### **cbsA is significantly associated with vascular pathogenesis**:
#### a SNP-based phylogeny where for each orthogroups we tested the hypothesis that transitions to vascular or non-vascular lifestyles were dependent on that orthogroups presence or absence

#### We identified two orthogroups whose presence was strongly associated (Log Bayes Factor >10) with the distribution of tissue-specific lifestyles

#### we focused on vascular pathogen-enriched OG0003492, which encodes a cell wall degrading cellobiohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.4, glycosylhydrolase family GH6) called CbsA

#### Next, phylogenetic analysis of CbsA sequences revealed that distinct monophyletic lineages within this gene family are alternatively found in either vascular or non-vascular pathogen genomes (Figure 1B)

#### CbsA sequences form two distinct clades: the first contains sequences found in both vascular and non-vascular pathogen genomes, and the second contains sequences found exclusively in vascular pathogen genomes.

### **Heterologous expression of cbsA bestows vascular pathogenesis to a non-vascular pathogen**:
#### Because cbsA was present in vascular and largely absent from non-vascular 
[[Xanthomonas]] species, we hypothesized that cbsA was either: 
##### A) gained by vascular Xanthomonas species
B) lost by non-vascular Xanthomonas species

#### effects of manipulating cbsA on the contrasting tissue-specific behavior of two closely related barley pathogens from the same species: vascular Xanthomonas translucens pvs. translucens (Xtt) and non-vascular undulosa(Xtu)

#### only Xtt can colonize the xylem which leads to long distance bacterial blight (BB) symptom development (Figure 2A-C)

#### X. translucens pv. undulosa contains a copy of cbsA that is disrupted in the 5’ region by a transposase (Fig. 4S)

#### Using GFP-expressing strains, we reproducibly observed Xtu miniTn7:cbsAXoo inside the xylem similar to Xtt

#### the gain of cbsA from either of two different vascular pathogens is sufficient to promote xylem-mediated colonization and distant infection of leaves by non-vascular Xtu.

### **Impact of cbsA mutagenesis on vascular pathogenesis is dependent on genetic background**:
#### We found that the Xtt ∆cbsA mutant was still capable of causing vascular leaf blight, suggesting other unknown factors support vascular pathogenesis beyond CbsA alone(Figure 2D&F)

#### the mutation of this cellulase altered this strain’s pathogenic behavior by promoting the development of non-vascular, water-soaked lesions downstream of the xylem blight on 90% of infected leaves compared with only 10% of leaves on plants infected with wild-type vascular Xtt (Figure 2E&F).

#### indicate that the robustness of vascular phenotypes is lineage dependent within Xanthomonas, with certain species likely possessing multiple determinants in addition to cbsA that contribute to vascular pathogenesis

### **cbsA has been repeatedly lost from lineages now displaying non-vascular lifestyles**:
#### While the majority of losses are inferred using parsimony criteria (e.g. losses in non-vascular strains of X. hortorum and X. fragariae; Methods), several cbsA pseudogenes present in extant species directly support the hypothesis of repeated, independent losses through distinct inactivation mechanisms

#### cbsA was independently pseudogenized in the non-vascular X. translucens pv. undulosa and X. sacchari through sequence deletions in its 5’ coding region
