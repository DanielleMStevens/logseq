- **Abstract**:
	- Pre-treatment of plants with [[ASM]] reduced the severity of the disease as well as the growth of the bacteria in planta
	- In plants treated with ASM, activities of [[peroxidase]] (POX) and 
	  [[glutathione peroxidase]] (GPX) were determined as markers of resistance
	- expressed earlier and with a much higher magnitude when ASM-treated seedlings were challenged with the pathogen
- **Introduction**:
	- [[SAR]] is characterized by a reduction in the number and severity of lesions following challenge inoculation with a normally virulent pathogen
	- The development of SAR is associated with various cellular defense 
	  responses include:
		- - synthesis of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins
- phytoalexins
- accumulation of reactive oxygen species ([[ROS]])
- rapid alterations in cell walls
- enhanced activity of various defence-related enzymes
	- [[ROS]], produced via an oxidative burst, are under the control of enzymes such as [[NADPH oxidase]] and peroxidases
	- POXs have been implicated in the crosslinking reactions of cell wall associated proteins such as hydroxyproline-rich or glycine-rich glycoproteins
	- As a result of oxidative cross-linking reactions, cell walls may be strengthened
- **Results**:
	- resistance induced by the [[ASM]] treatment was already evident 4 dpi and lasted for the entire experimental period (until 14 dpi)
	- disease index was reduced by 75% in [[ASM]]-treated seedlings 7 dpi, and this was maintained at the same level until 14 dpi

	- The growth of Cmm was markedly reduced in ASM-treated seedlings compared with the water-treated control
	- bacterial population was reduced by 62.8, 68.2 and 60.5% by ASM

	- In tomato plants treated with ASM, the expression of induced resistance was associated with enhanced POX activity
	- POX activity increased with time and reached the highest level 5 dpi
	- Treatment of seedlings with ASM followed by inoculation with Cmm also resulted in a marked increase in GPX activity
	- The activity observed by 5 days was significantly higher than that of control plants

- **Discussion**:
	- Similar enhanced disease resistance induced by [[ASM]] was shown in tomato plants against fungal, bacterial and viral disease agents
	- In tomato, bacterial growth of [[Pseudomonas syringae]] pv. tomato was not significantly inhibited by ASM in vitro
	- suggesting that the protection of tomato seedlings against pathogens is due to activation of the plant defense mechanisms.
