title: PLP228 - Huanglongbing - Citrus Greening
---

## **Candidatus Liberibacter spp. **
### C. L. asiaticus, C. L. africanus, Ca. L. americanus

### [[Gram-negative pathogens]], non-culturable, heat tolerant bacteria (not Calf) with true cell wall

### Shaped as elongated sinuous rod of uneven diameter 0.15 - 0.25 um

### Restricted to sieve tubes of phloem vessels; low titer

### Wide host range, on members of the [[Rutaceous]], [[Solanaceous]]

### Oranges and mardarins are more susceptible 

### Tranmsited by psyllids, graftings, and dodders

### Taxaonomy: Phyloum - proteobacteria, class - alphaproteobacteria, order - rhizobiales, family- phylobacteriaceae, genus - liberibacter

### 

## **Economic Impact**
### ^^The disease^^
#### Most devastating citrus disease in existance

#### 30-100% infection with an avg. 68.8%

#### Infected fruit has no value

#### No cure, little resistance/tolerance 

#### Present in Florida, California, Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina, Texas

### ^^The Citrus Industry^^
#### Total production in US, 6.13 million tons, value of ~ $3.3 billion dollars (2017-18)

#### California accounts over 59%, Florida 36%

#### Florida lost over 50% of citrus plants at a cost of $7 billion in total industry output in the 2005-2014 period

#### 3,900 jobs lost (49% total agricultural sector), 2,500 citrus growers remaining in business, out of 8,000 ten years ago

#### federal government funded $125 million for national citrus greening research

## **Asian citrus psyllid (ACP)**
### __Diaphorina citri__, Kuwayama, 1908

### Center of origin: tropical and subtropical Asia

### ^^Narrow host range^^: mainly __Citrus__ spp., and members of [[Rutaceous]]

### First found in Florida in 1998 on orange jasmine - the Asian-native ornamental plant

### Subsequently found in Texas in 2001, San Diego in 2008, Arizona in 2009, Virgin Island in 2010

## **Genomics**
### Genome reduction compared to other Rhizobacteriaceae

### No [[CAZymes]]

### Lack key enzymes for oxidative phosphorylation -> anaerobic respirtory

### No T2SS, T3SS & T4SS

### Carries T1SS for multidrug efflux and secretion of toxins, effectors, and hyrolases

### ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins present in teh genome -> involved in phosphate uptake and sugar transport

### ATP synthase and ATP/ADP translocase -> synthesize ATP and directly scavenge from host

## **Symptoms of HLB**
### 'yellow dragon disease', branches/shoots turn yellow as early symptoms

### long and variable latent period

### canopy thinning, twig dieback, discolored leaves, declining & death

### Leaf: normal size, yellow discoloration or blotchy-mottle similar to Zn deficiencies, yellow corky veins 

### Root: poor development, few fibrous

### Fruit: smaller, asymmetric, small brownish aborted seeds, drop prematurely, yellow/orange upper-half while bottom remains green

### juice: low sucrose and total sugars; high citric acid, limonin & nomilin -> sour and bitter taste

## **Host colonization and symptom induction**
### Reduced genome size and lack of most TSSs, CWDEs mean that C. L. asiaticus primarily relies on escaping recognition by the host immune system

### No evident pathogencity yet, since analysis of the genome revealed very limit number of toxins, offensive enzymes,or specialized secretion systems

### Should be better described as a **parasite** rather than a pathogen 

### Disese symptoms induced primarily as a result of host metabolic imbalances
#### plugging of sieve pores by callose deposition

#### massive accumulation of starch in leaves -> starvation of the roots

### How C. L. asiaticus is able to infect such a wide variety of citrus plants and their relatives is currently under investiagtion

### UPDATE: **Sec-delivered effector 1** (SDE1) inhbits the activity of the citrus papain-like cyteine proteases (PLCPs) which known as a plant defensive response

## **Transmission**
### Persistent progative circulatige pathogen: passed through every numphal stages to adults, remains for life-time, and can be found in various insect organs

### Acquire-time: 15-30 minutes feeding on infected plant
#### Nymphs acquire the bacteria much better than adult psyllid

### Latent period: ranging 2-3 weeks

### Only psyllids carry bacteria thru its nymphal stages can infect heathy trees
#### Clas bacterium need to reach a certain threshold level within the psyllids in order to transmit efficiently, which can only be reached if Clas was acquired by its vector during the nymphal rather than the adult stage

## **Management**
### Removal of symptomatic trees to reduce inculum levels

### No specific chemicals that can eliminate the bacteria

### Geographical isolation

### Control psyllids with insectcides

### Only use certificatied pathogen-free budwoods for grafting, illegal to bring citrus trees, leaves, or whole plants from other states or countries

### Sugar belle, a mandarin hybrid, more tolerant than most varieties 

### Application of foliar nutritional spray with salicylic acid and/or phosphite

### Florida citrus nursey industry move under greenhouse

### Lady beetles are important predators of the psyllid

### The parasitoid wasps lays eggs on the nymphs, the larva feeds on, kills the psyllid, then emerges as an adult through a hole that it chews on the nymphs outer-shell

### Trained K-9 dogs can actually smell the bacteria within a few weeks after infection

## **Possible control?**
### **Brassinosterols**
#### 10-15 HLB-infected time (2 years - 1 month), under greenhouse/field, similar initial bacterial titers

#### Sprayed till dripping (0.084 uM and 1 uM) 24-epibrassinotide (eBL) every 15 days for 12 months

#### Evaluation: leaves (include symtomatic ones), every three months, qPCR quantification

#### Results: bacterial titers decreased significantly, up to 160-fold reduction after 3 months

#### 0.084 uM eBL up-regulate defense gene expressions in HLB plants 
##### Gluthione peroxidases (GPX1)

##### Fatty acid hydroperoxide lyase (HPL)

##### Allene oxide synthase (AOS)

##### Phenylalinine ammonia lyase (PAL)

#### Might provide a useful tool within IPM
