- **Abstract**:
	- based on 16S rRNA and genome-based DNA homology there is evidence to elevate to species-level
	- 2300 CDSs are shared across all the subspecies
	- Cms and Cmi had the highest number of pseudogenes, an indication of potential degenerating genomes
	- twenty-eight plasmid-borne CDSs in the other subspecies were found to have homologues in the chromosomal genome of Cmn which is known not to carry plasmids
		- CDSs include pathogenesis-related factors such as Endocellulases E1 and Beta-glucosidase
- **Introduction**:
	- The cells are
		- (i) rods of coryneform morphology,
		  (ii) having B2γ-type cell wall peptidoglycan with the diaminobutyric acid MK-9 as the predominant menaquinone,
		  (iii) phosphatidyglycerol and diphosphatidyglycerol as the basic polar lipids,
		  (iv) a high [[G+C content]] of 72–74%
	- All subspecies have been reported to invade seeds, and seems to poorly survive in soil
	- Since the genome of Cmn2581 does not carry any plasmids, it can be hypothesized that the disease-inducing virulence factors are also chromosomally encoded alongside genes involved in successful host colonization
- **Results**:
	- **Verification of strain identity and genomic relationship**:
		- GenBank database showed that the 16S rDNA sequences of both strains exhibited more than 99%
	- **Summary statistics and general features of the genomes**
		- The genome sizes ranged from 3.06 (Cmn) to 3.41Mb (Cmi). All the subspecies genomes possess 2 or 3 plasmids except Cmn that has no plasmid
		- The number of protein-coding genes with function is between 2201 (Cmn) and 2341  (Cmi) with 18 to 114 pseudogene
		- The genome atlas of Cms ATCC33113 exhibits, at least, 31 inverted repeat regions while Cmi R1-1 has about 14
		- All the subspecies have three or more direct repeats, with Cms ATCC33113 having the highest number of direct repeats

	- **Comparative genomics**:
		- some of the plasmid-borne CDSs showed homologies to chromosomal genome of Cmn NCPPB2581 known to not carry plasmids
- **Discussion**:
	- Cmn has the smallest genome, resulting in the fewest number of protein-coding genes, suggesting that colonizing and living in corn leaf tissues requires relatively few genes
	- Cms and Cmi had the highest number of non-functional pseudogenes which might reduce the coding capacity of these strains, suggesting possible degeneration of the genome
	- Copper, an essential trace and redox active element, serves as a cofactor for several enzymes. Inaerobic cells, excess Cu metal ion can produce cytotoxic reactive oxygen species capable of damaging DNA, lipids and proteins. A CDS that is chromosomally encoding Copper-translocating P-type ATPase (copA; EC 3.6.3.4), repressor CsoR of the   copZA operon, and Copper (I) chaperone CopZ; two CDSs each encoding for Copper resis-   tance protein Cop Ca are present in all the subspecies.
