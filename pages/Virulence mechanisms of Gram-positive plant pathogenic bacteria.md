## **Abstract**:
### though plant virulence genes are frequently located on plasmids or in 
laterally acquired gene clusters, they are rarely shared with Gram-negative bacterial plant pathogens and among Gram-positive genera

### variety of virulence strategies to invade their plant hosts, including the production of phytotoxins to allow intracellular and intercellular replication, production of cytokinins to generate gall tissues for invasion, secretion of proteins to induce cankers and the utilization and manipulation of sap-feeding insects for introduction into the phloem sieve cells.

## **Introduction**:
### Phylogenetic distance (Figure 1) and fundamental differences in cell 
structure between Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria predict that 
these bacteria do not share vertically transferred plant pathogenicity 
genes

### Gram-positive bacteria, the [[Actinobacteria]] (high [[G+C content]]) and the [[Firmicutes]] (low [[G+C content]]), diverged very early in evolutionary history

### [[Actinobacteria]] genera Clavibacter [2], [[Streptomyces]] [3], Leifsonia [4] 
and Rhodococcus [5] and in the [[Firmicutes]] genera Spiroplasma [6] and 
Candidatus Phytoplasma [7], both of which lie within the class 
Mollicutes [8,9], support a model of phyla-specific virulence genes 
enhanced through [[Horizontal Gene Transfer]] (HGT).

**Figure 1:The Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria diverged early in evolutionary history. **The 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences of 
representative species were aligned in ClustalX v. 1.83 [50]. The  alignment served as input for generating a phylogenetic tree using the Neighbour Joining (NJ) method [51] of ClustalX. Positions with gaps were excluded from the tree calculations. Confidence values of a 1000 bootstrap trials are indicated at the nodes. The tree was visualized in NJ Plot [52] and Dendroscope [53] software.

## **Host colonization and symptomology**:
### Plant pathogenic Actinobacteria in the genera [[Streptomyces]] and 
Rhodococcus have very wide host ranges, including economically important crops and model plants.

### [[Streptomyces]] scabies is the most widely distributed and best studied of 
at least 10 species that cause scab diseases of potato and other laterally expanding underground plant tissues and share virulence genes

### However, these pathogens readily infect monocot and dicot seedlings, causing root rot and seedling death; the lack of host specificity corresponds to the inability of scab-causing streptomycetes to produce the hypersensitive response

### [[Rhodococcus]] fascians also infects both monocot and dicot hosts, many of which are economically important

### Extensive epiphytic growth precedes intercellular invasion through stomata. Leaf deformation, witches’ broom symptoms, fasciations and leafy galls are caused by hyper induction of shoots through activation of dormant axillary meristems and de novo meristem formation. Symptoms are believed to be the result of elaborate manipulation of host hormone balances and pathogen derived auxin and cytokinin

### [[clavibacter]] and [[Leifstonia]] are host-specific at the species or subspecies level
#### Genome comparisons show substantial gene content diversity within the species, apparently driven by differences in the ecology of the 
subspecies

### [[Clavibacter sepedonicus]] lives as an endophyte in a vegetatively propagated crop while [[Clavibacter michiganensis]] also grows epiphytically and infects seeds and epidermal tissue

### [[Leifstonia]] xyli subsp. xyli, (Lxx) the causative agent of a systemic disease called ratoon stunting of sugarcan

### Plant growth inhibition, the hallmark of this disease, may be due to a putative fatty acid desaturase that modifies the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway to produce abscisic acid, a growth inhibitor

## **Virulence factors**:
### The lack of a type III protein secretion system (T3SS) in Firmicutes and
 [[Actinobacteria]] immediately raises questions about delivery of virulence proteins across the plant cell wall and membrane

### S. scabies, [[Streptomyces]] turgidiscabies and S. acidiscabies directly penetrate plant cell walls with the help of [[thaxtomin A]], a phytotoxin that inhibits [[cellulose]] biosynthesis (reviewed in [3]), presumably allowing  secretion of proteins at the host cell membrane. These pathogens secrete Nec1, a novel protein that is proposed to suppress host defence through an unknown mechanism

### Homologues of CelA that lack the expansin-like domain are present in 
other xylem colonizing plant pathogens, including Cms and [[Leifstonia]] xyli subsp. xyli,  suggesting a role in degradation of xylem cell walls.

### There is a single Chp homologue in [[Leifstonia]] xyli subsp. xyli, but Cms contains 11 members of the Chp family

### Biosynthesis is via a nonribosomal peptide pathway and includes a nitric oxide (NO) synthase; NO is utilized in the nitration of the tryptophan moiety [31] and NO is released at the host– pathogen interface where it is available to modulate host signaling

### [[thaxtomin A]] inhibits the synthesis of [[cellulose]] in expanding plant cells 
via an unknown mechanism that appears to be conserved among higher 
plants

### [[thaxtomin A]] and other members of the thaxtomin family are produced 
exclusively by scab-causing streptomycetes, an example of a novel 
pathogenicity determinant, and the biosynthetic pathway is carried on a 
[[pathogenicity island]], mobilization of which is responsible for emergence of pathogenic species in agricultural systems

### Thaxtomin and NO are induced by cellobiose, which is a ligand for the [[AraC/XylE transcriptional regulator]] TxtR

### the fas operon also exists on the PAI of S. turgidiscabies; it confers on this soil borne pathogen the ability to produce leafy galls on aerial plant parts

## **[[Horizontal Gene Transfer]]: a short cut to virulence**:
### The [[tomA]] gene, which is believed to be involved suppression of plant 
defence responses, has a homologue on the PAI of S. turgidiscabies

### [[pathogenicity island]] resides on a 660 kb integrative conjugative element that also encodes the thaxtomin biosynthetic pathway, nec1 and the fas operon, and is capable of mobilizing to other [[Streptomyces]] spp. [35]. The fas operon on this PAI is homologous and colinear and with the fas operon of [[Rhodococcus]] fascians

### [[Leifstonia]] xyli subsp. xyli genome has four HGT regions encoding pectinases and polygalacturonases and a 50-kb HGT region harbouring a celA homologue
