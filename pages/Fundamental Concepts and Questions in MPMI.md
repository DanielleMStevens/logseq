title: Fundamental Concepts and Questions in MPMI
---

## **Basic Concepts**:
### Living plants are resistant to most pathogens. Organic matter in the form of dead tissue, including tissue which was resistant in the living state, can support the growth of microbial saprophytes, but not generally obligate parasites. Non-obligate pathogens can persist as saprophytes, endophytes, and epiphytes.

## **__Major questions, most unresolved which require combined molecular, genetic, biochemical, and cellular dissection:__**
### What is basic (aka "non-host") resistance?

### What is basic compatibility?

### Was evolution, on a case by case basis, to resistance or compatibility, or neither?

### What is specific compatibilty?

### What is specific resistance?

### What is pathogenicity?

### What is viruence?

## 

## Some observations and general conclusions supported by the literature:
### There must be something inducible or constitutive in living plants which precludes the growth of nonpathogens, either directly detrimental or inhibiting their ability to access nutrients necessary for growth and reproduction. 

### There is no presumed single mechanism in that there may be several factors and combinations of factors for different microbes which contribute to basic resistance.

### Basic resistance is not necessarily specific for any single microbe. Basic resistance could be due to mechianical barriers such as impenetrable cell walls or restriction of nutrient access which are negated during tissue maturation and programmed senescence.

### Specific resistance to pathogen races, wxpressed by cultivar resistance, occurs against a background of failed basic resistance or induced susceptibility. What does this mean?

### The expression of basic resistance to fungal pathogens which penetrate indirectly often does not involve cell death.

### Expression of specific resistance often is associated with localized cell death in the host under controlled conditions but the evidence for a dependent role of cell death in resistance is lacking. This is in spite of what much of the literature assumes. 

### Susceptibility is said to occur when the microbe overcomes basic resistance. This may be due to pathogenicity factors/effectors, resulting in either an active suppression of the defense responses or a failure to trigger the defense response (i.e., either the presence or absence of a pathogen feature) 

### 

## **__These factors may evolve for reasons other than their involvement in parasitism. However it is difficult to argue, for example, that the ability to differentiate specialized fungal structures such as appressoria evolved in the absence of selective advantages of parasitism. Do appressoria have a role in saprophytism? What is (are) the analogies in bacteria? Hrp genes, various secretion systems, toxins, hormones, effectors, etc.__**
### In the case of biotrophs, susceptibility is associated with delayed cell death. In contrast, in the case of necrotrophs host cell death is prior to or coincident with, and likely essential for, pathogen growth in the host and the expression of symptoms.  

### In the case necrotrophs, can susceptibility be induced by triggering senescence or apoptosis-associated pathways?

### Is a comparable situation completely avoided in the case of biotrophs or temporally avoided in the case of hemibiotrophs?

## **__What are the signal transduction pathways that lead to the expression of cell death-dependent susceptibility to necrotrophs and what are the similarities and differences to the HR-dependent cell death. Are there common features tot he programmed cell death of foliar  senescence or fruit ripening and the processes of cell death associated with either susceptibility or HR? __**
### Need for coordinated assessment of gene expression in plants undergoing reactions associated with all the three stages of plant response (but keep in mind that gene expression is only one facet of the response).

## **The following are questions we pose in experimental studies in MPMI.**

## **__Broad questions regarding nonhost resistance which require combined molecular, genetic, biochemical, and cellular dissection__**
### 1. What response(s) are triggered in nonhost plants by cellular pathogens? 
What responses are triggered in host plants of pathogens and nonpathogenic mutants?
This includes determining up and down regulation of gene expression as well as metabolic regulation of changes in constitutive biochemical pathways. How do we sort out what is determinative vs. what is spurious and inconsequential? Note the limitations of transcriptomics - only tells us what transcripts accumulate.

### 2. Are the same responses in a single plant elicited by all microbes? (unsuccessful biotrophs as well as necrotrophs; direct vs. indirect penetrators; classes of pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and nematodes)

### 3. What microbial feature or function triggers these responses? 

### 4. Which, if any, of these responses are responsible for resistance?

### 5. How does one identify mutants or differentially regulate the response pathways to establish cause and effect relationships, and what are the limitations of these genetic approaches?

### 6. Which, if any, responses are triggered in pathogens vs. nonpathogens by morphological or chemical factors associated with host and nonhost plants during determinative phases? 

### 7. Are these triggered (elicited) by pathogenic organisms and, if not, (as in biotrophs), why not?

### 8. Can any of these responses be altered in either functional or ability to be elicited in order to engineer durable resistance in crop plants?

### 9. What signals enable plants to prioritize their adaptive responses to diverse stresses? 

## **__Broad questions regarding specific resistance which require combined molecular, genetic, biochemical, and cellular dissection__**
### 1. What are the responses trggered at the cellular level by the invasion of the microbe?

### 2. Are the same responses elicited by different races of the same pathogen or nonpathogenic isolates of the same species?

### 3. What microbe function, feature, or metabolite triggers the response?

### 4. Which of the presumed cascade of responses following microbe-plant encounter are necessary for resistance or susceptibility?

### 5. Is there a relationship between the pathogen genes controlling parasitic ability and those host genes controlling susceptibility, either in term of regulation or function?

### 6. What are the genes governing basic compatibility?

## **__Broad questions regarding susceptibility which require combined molecular, genetic, biochemical, and cellular dissection.__**
### 1. Do pathogens co-opt specific host metabolism to create an environment in which colonization can or necessarily will occur?

### 2. If so, does this involve altered or new host gene expression? What are the communicative signal moleculaes that regulate this expression?

### 3. What is the functional significance of host metabolism in normal growth and development of the healthy plant compared to a disease plant and a plant resisting a potwntial pathogen?

### What are the evolutionary drivers of effectors either of susceptibility or resistance? Is virulence of non-obligate pathogens plant drive or is a compatible/susceptible plant merely an assay for a function that evolved independently of the host plant?
