-
- **To-Do**:
	- Finish SA treatment against Cm Disease Development Assays
	- Measure output via ethylene production
		- Requires an autosampler for GC-FID
	- Measure disease for EFR Transgenics
	- Measure disease for CORE Transgenics
	- [[Measure release of immunogenic peptides]]
	- Test MAMP antagonism in CM
		- When looking at previous MAMP antagonizers:
			- For csp22, antagonism was showned for: C and D, alkalinization induced by the harpin-containing preparation messenger (1g/ml,C) and by a crude extract fromA. tumefaciens (1l/ml,D) in cellswithout pretreatment or cells pretreated for 3 min with 3 uM/mL csp15-Ala10 as indicated
