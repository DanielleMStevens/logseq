## **Abstract**:
### Nearly complete sequences (97-99%) of the 16s rRNA genes were determined for type strains of [[Clavibacter michiganensis]], [[Clavibacter insidiosus]], [[Clavibacter insidiosus]], and [[Clavibacter nebraskensis]]

### The four subspecies had less than 1% dissimilarity in their 16s rRNA gene

### shared relatively high homology with the 16s rRNA gene of Clavibacter xyli

## **Introduction**:
### plant-pathogenic [[coryneform]] bacteria were transferred into different genera such as [[Rhodococcus]] (Goodfellow 1984), and Arthrobacter (Collins et al. 1981), and the genera [[Curtobacterium]] (Collins and Jones 1983) and [[clavibacter]] (Davis et al. 1984) were established

### Clavibacter michiganensis currently includes five subspecies, each of which is highly  specific on different plant hosts [(Carlson and Vidaver 1982)]([[Bacterial Mosaic a New Corynebacterial Disease of Wheat]])

### high G+C% values, low metabolic activity, similar cell wall composition, and similar but distinct protein profiles on electrophoretic polyacrylamide gels

### 16s rRNA genes, amplified from genomic DNA of four subspecies of Clavibacter michiganensis, were sequenced
#### [[Clavibacter michiganensis]]: [[LMG7333]]
[[Clavibacter sepedonicus]]: LMG2889
[[Clavibacter insidiosus]]: LMG3663
[[Clavibacter nebraskensis]] LMG5627

## **Results**:
### The 16s rRNA gene sequences were highly conserved among the four subspecies, and dissimilarity values ranged from 0.3 to 0.7%

## **Discussion**:
### 16s rRNA gene sequence data support current classification of Clavibacter michiganensis and Clavibacter xyli as related phytopathogenic species

### Together with several other phytopathogenic species including Clavibacter rathayi, Clavibacter iranicum, and Clavibacter tritici, these bacteria differ from other coryneform bacteria in their cell wall compositions

### [[Rathayibacter]], was proposed to accommodate Clavibacter rathayi,  Clavibacter iranicum and Clavibacter tritici on the basis of cell wall 
composition, physiological characteristics, and DNA base composition
