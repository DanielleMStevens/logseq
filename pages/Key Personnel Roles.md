## Clearly describe the roles and responsibilities of the PD, collaborator(s), mentor(s) etc. (biographical sketches for key personnel including mentor(s) should not be included here). If it will be necessary to enter into formal consulting or collaborative arrangements with others, such arrangements should be fully explained and justified. Evidence (letters of support) for this type of collaboration should be provided in the ‘Documentation of Collaboration’ attachment (see item 5) below).
