## **Abstract**:
### Wheat was the only host that showed symptoms after innoculation

### The pathogen reached high population levels ($$>10^5$$ CFUs per gram of fresh weight tissue) without symptoms in tomato and 6/9 gramineous plants in greenhouse tests

## **Introduction**:

## **Results**:
### Populations of $$1x10^5$$ to $$1x10^8$$ CFU/g of fresh wight were found in field-grown wheat when assayed on CNS medium

### Preliminary results showed that the bacterial mosaic pathogen was seed associated infestations was probably external, because treatment with 0.5% NaClO killed the pathogen

### The distribution of the pathogen in the study: Ct was isolated from winter wheat grown in 17 counties of Nebraskia and Iowa

### No symptoms were seen in other grasses when artificially inoculated, even when C. tessellarius populations reached high levels

### Grasses that supported latent infections of the bacterial mosaic pathogen were barley, oats, sweet corn, sudan grass, wild rye, and smooth brome 

### Teosinte, sorghum, and shattercan did not support high populations of the pathogen

### Populations of incompatible pathogens were always less than the population of the compatible pathogen in each host

### Wheat showed no symptoms when inoculated with either of the incompatible pathogens (Cm and Cn), and neither corn nor tomato developed symptoms when inoculated with the bacterial mosaic pathogen 

## **Discussion**:
### We do not know whether these latent infections are significant in natural disease progression, serving as a pathogen reservior or as an overwintering stage

### Unlike Cn and Cm, which readily streamed from lesions, Ct lacked bacterial streaming
