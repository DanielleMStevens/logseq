title: Evolution and Diversity of Known MAMPs in plant-associated Actinobacteria
---

- **Deadlines Related:**
- Fig1 sup. Use same color scheme throughout
- Sup. Fig.2 Add membrane info
- General Ideas: are they trends (maskers, antagonizers) based on relationship with host type (i.e. solanacea)
-
- **To-Do:**
	- MLSA Tree mining for known MAMPS
	  ID:: 8c5d9cc5-25a6-462c-858f-bd2ee024cb23
		- housekeeping genes: ftsY, ~~infH~~, proB, rsmA, secY, ~~tsaP~~, ychF
		- ftsY, ychF, rpoB, secY, tsaD, infB
		- - need to fix: find more better housekeeping genes to survey, convert blastn to tblastn and remake treee
		- - tip colored by generaâ€‹
		- - rings of heatmaps by percent similarity to consensus epitopes (flg22, [[csp22]], elf18, nlp20)
		- Add in genomes from Xanthamonas, Psuedomonas, and Ralsotnia
		- How does this differ for lower gc bacteria
	- If Nep-1 is none existant in Actinobacteria, evolutionary tree of when loss event occurred
		- Assess additional genomes in this data set if possible: https://www.readcube.com/library/95fd6ff6-fca1-4a81-9ddb-c57079c1e1f2:08d9b13a-ba20-4c63-9d7f-ddd56a01f075
	- Look at bimodoal distribution of full length vs. peptide (with and without pathogenicity)
