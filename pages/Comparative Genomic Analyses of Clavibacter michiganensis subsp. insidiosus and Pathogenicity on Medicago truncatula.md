## **Abstract**:
### Three [[Clavibacter insidiosus]] strains varied in gene content due to genome rearrangements, most likely facilitated by [[insertion elements]], and [[plasmid number]], which varied from one to three depending on strain

### core genome consisted of 1,917 genes, with 379 genes unique to C. insidiosus

### operon for synthesis of the extracellular blue pigment indigoidine, enzymes for [[pectin degradation]], and an operon for [[inositol metabolism]] are among the unique features

### [[serine proteases]] belonging to both the [[pat-1]] and [[ppa]] families were present but highly diverged from those in other species
