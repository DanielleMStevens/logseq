title: Wright-Fisher model
---

- Our focus in this section is on the effects of demographic stochasticity in finite populations. To this end, we introduce the Wright-Fisher model, first for a haploid population. The assumptions of this model are as follows:
	- 1. Non-overlapping generations
	- 2. Constant population size: N haploid adults
	- 3. Autosomal locus segregating alleles A and a
	- 4. No selection or mutation
	- 5. Each individual in generation t+1 chooses its parent uniformly at random and with replacement from the N adults alive in generation t
-
- The last assumption (‘Wright-Fisher sampling’) is made for convenience, but can also be justified biologically if we assume that each adult in generation t gives birth to a large number of offspring (say M), but that the environment only contains enough resources for N of these to survive to adulthood.
-
- Although simplistic, the Wright-Fisher model captures many of the key features of [[genetic drift]] and has played an important role in the development of population genetics. Here we are interested in two aspects of its behavior:
	- short-term fluctuations in allele frequencies
	- asymptotic properties of the model
-
- In other words, while the average allele frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation (reflecting the absence of selection and mutation), the actually allele frequencies will change at a rate that is inversely proportional to population size. These unbiased, random
  fluctuations in the genetic composition of the population are known as genetic drift, which the Wright-Fisher model suggests is stronger in smaller populations.
