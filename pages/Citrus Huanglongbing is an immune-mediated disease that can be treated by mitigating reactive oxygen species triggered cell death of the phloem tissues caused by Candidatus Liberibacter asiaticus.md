- **Abstract**:
	- Here we present evidence that citrus HLB is an immune-mediated disease. This hypothesis explains most phenomena observed for HLB, fits the genetic information of Ca. Liberibacter spp., and also provides guidance regarding HLB management.
- **Introduction**:
- **Results**:
	- **CLas does not contain pathogenicity factors that directly cause HLB symptoms**
		- Ca. Liberibacter spp. do not contain the type II, III, and IV secretion systems that secrete such pathogenicity factors.
- **Discussion**:
