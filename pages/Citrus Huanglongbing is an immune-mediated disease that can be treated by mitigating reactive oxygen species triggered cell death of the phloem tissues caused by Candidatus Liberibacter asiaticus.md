	- Here we present evidence that citrus HLB is an immune-mediated disease. This hypothesis explains most phenomena observed for HLB, fits the genetic information of Ca. Liberibacter spp., and also provides guidance regarding HLB management.
- **Introduction**:
- **Results**:
	- **CLas does not contain pathogenicity factors that directly cause HLB symptoms**
		- Ca. Liberibacter spp. do not contain the type II, III, and IV secretion systems that secrete such pathogenicity factors.
		- 47 predicated virulence factors including serralysin and hemolysin
		  70 (substrates of type I secretion system) and proteins containing Sec secretion signals (Table S1)
		  71 (9) were overexpressed in Arabidopsis thaliana, Nicotiana tabacum or Citrus paradisi. None of
		  72 the overexpressed CLas proteins caused HLB-like symptoms, consistent with the bioinformatic
		  73 analyses that CLas does not contain pathogenicity factors that directly cause HLB symptoms.
