	- Here we present evidence that citrus HLB is an immune-mediated disease. This hypothesis explains most phenomena observed for HLB, fits the genetic information of Ca. Liberibacter spp., and also provides guidance regarding HLB management.
- **Introduction**:
- **Results**:
	- **CLas does not contain pathogenicity factors that directly cause HLB symptoms**
		- Ca. Liberibacter spp. do not contain the type II, III, and IV secretion systems that secrete such pathogenicity factors.
		- 47 predicated virulence factors including serralysin and hemolysin (substrates of type I secretion system) and proteins containing Sec secretion signals (Table S1) (9) were overexpressed in Arabidopsis thaliana, Nicotiana tabacum or Citrus paradisi. None of the overexpressed CLas proteins caused HLB-like symptoms, consistent with the bioinformatic analyses that CLas does not contain pathogenicity factors that directly cause HLB symptoms.
	- **CLas infection triggers immune response and cell death in the phloem tissues**
		- We trimmed HLB positive and healthy two-year-old C. sinensis ‘Valencia’ trees in a greenhouse to trigger young flush and conducted dynamic analyses of the relationship between CLas infection, immune response, cell death, and HLB symptom development.

		- To have a better understanding of the nature of the immune response induced by CLas, we conducted temporal expression analyses of immune marker genes (PR1, PR2, PR3, and PR5) in young leaves at 15-, 18-, 21-, 24-, 27-, and 60-days post-bud initiation for the CLas infected and healthy C. sinensis plants. PR genes were consistently induced by CLas despite some fluctuations between 15- and 60-day-post-bud initiation (fig. S1).
		- We observed cell death of sieve element and companion cells via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of asymptomatic young leaves of HLB positive C. sinensis ‘Valencia’ trees (Fig. 2A-D), indicating cell death of phloem tissues occurs prior to the appearance of HLB symptoms. CLas was observed in phloem tissues with intact sieve element and companion cells, but not in sieve element cells undergoing the cell death process (Fig. 2C-E).

		- Cell death was observed in CLas positive asymptomatic leaves, and leaves with mild or severe HLB symptoms and correlated positively with symptom development (Fig. 3A).
