- **Lamarckism:** an organism can pass on to its offspring physical characteristics that the parent aquired though use or disuse during its lifetiem
	- By French biologist Jean-Baptiste Lemarck (~1850-1860s)
- **Mendelian inheritance** (2 main laws)
	- 1. [[Law of Segregation]]: during gamete formation, the alleles for each gene segregate from each other so that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene
		- molecular proof was by the observation of meiosis
	- 2. [[Law of Independent Assortment]]: genes of different traits can segregate independently from one another during the formation of gametes
	- 3. Law of dominance: an organism with at least one dominant alleles will display the effect of the dominant allele
-
- **What is a Mendelian trait?**
	- one that is controlled by a single locus in an inhertiance pattern
		- dominant disease manifest in heterzygous individuals
-
- **Non-Mendelian Inheritance**:
	- 1. [[Incomplete dominance]]: occurs when the phenotype of a heterozygous genotype is distant from and often intermediate to phenotype of homozygous genotypes
		- ex. snapdragons
	- 2. [[Co-dominance]]: occurs when the phenotype of a heterozygous genotype is a visible contribution of both alleles
		- ex. camellia flower, blood types
	- 3. [[Polygenic traits]]: traits that are controlled by more than one gene
		- - alleles of each gene have a minor additive effect on the phenotype
	- 4. [[Pleiotropic traits]]: genes that affect more than one phenotypic trait
		- ex. __vg__ gene in flies, controls wing development: 
		  flies homozygous recessive for the __vg__ locus develop short wings = cannot fly; 
		  indirectly __vg__ gene changes the number of egg strings in the fly's ovaries, thus decreasing lifespan of fly
	- 5. [[epistasis]]: 2 or more loci contribute to a single phenotype and their effects are not additive with an allele at one locus typically masking or modifying the effects of other loci involved
		- - genes involved in an [[epistasis]] interaction may still show independent assortment at the genotypic level, however, phenotypic ratio would deviate
		- examples of [[epistasis]] ratios
