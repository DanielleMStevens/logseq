title: Citrus brainstorming notes - 10.5.2020
---

- IsoSeq – how much? Do we need this after MAMP treatment to increase defense transcript expression?
- Should we sequence another type I or II mandarin? Chandrika can test by ROS fairly quickly?
- Genomes: Washington Navel (DS), Lisbon Lemon (GC), Valencia Orange (published), Tango Mandarin (DS, type 3, hybrid). Chandrika is sequencing __Microcitrus__ spp may share data.
- Cost:
- HiFi: PacBioSequel II $1800/SMRT cell; library is $423
- IsoSeq: PacBioSequel II $1800/SMRT cell; library is $400,
- HiC: NXG Bio $1164 per sample including library prep, Arima genomics $1940 for library, $1200 for illumina lane that could be multiplexed 4x
- Genome with HiFi + HiC: $3,387
- IsoSeq: $2,200 per sample if run on single SMRT cell
- Purpose:
- Comparative genomics between sweet orange, mandarin(s), secondarily Lemon – RLK/RLP repertoire, kinome, defense signaling proteins
- Functional analyses – comparative genomics looks promising, we can identify two genotypes to perform IsoSeq + pathogen induction? 10K (4 samples).
- How to sample for IsoSeq – 2 genomes one sweet orange, one mandarin: **Induced sample after MAMP treatment leaf**, leaf alone, **vascular tissue after MAMP treatment on lower leaf**, fruit, flower (Valencia Orange, Mandarin)
- Enrichment sequencing: RLK/RLP (like NBS-LRR RenSeq). Here you can compare many genomes. This point would be better after we determine what differences may be interesting at the genome level. And layer on using Chandrika’s population that has been phenotyped.
