## **Abstract**:
### [[Clavibacter nebraskensis]], the causal organism of Goss’s wilt and leaf blight of maize, can be detected in the phyllosphere of its host prior to disease development.

### 37 putative isolates of [[Clavibacter nebraskensis]] recovered from asymptomatic and symptomatic maize leaves

### irrespective of the source of isolation and all but four of these isolates were pathogenic on maize. The remaining 4 isolates recovered from asymptomatic leaves had large fluidal yellow colonies, and were non-pathogenic on maize.

### Sequence polymorphisms were detected in 5 genes, cellulase A, two endoglucanases, xylanase B and a pectate lyase but there was no relationship with pathogenicity.

## **Introduction**:
### After decades of reduced incidence, the disease recently reemerged throughout the Midwest [1, 4–6] Texas, [7, 8], Louisiana [9, 10], and in Canada [3, 8, 11]. Significant yield losses of up to 50% have been recorded, and usually depend on the crop developmental stage at which the maize hybrid was infected [12].

### Goss’s leaf blight is more common and is characterized by large elongated leaf lesions with characteristic small (<1mm2) dark green to black water soaked spots in the periphery of the lesions.

### Although infected seed can be a source of inoculum [13,14,15], the main source of inoculum for Goss’s wilt and leaf blight is surface Cmn-infested residue within which the bacterium is able to survive for at least 10 months [5, 16].

### [Smidt and Vidaver]([[Corynebacterium nebraskense, a New, Orange-Pigmented Phytopathogenic Species]]) detected Cmn on asymptomatic corn leaves in the field and suggested an epiphytic phase for the pathogen that may contribute to disease development.

## **Results**:
### **Morphological characteristics of isolates, pathogenicity, and aggressiveness on maize**:
#### Among the 37 putative Cmn strains, only NE1, NE2 and CL1 contained single large plasmids that were estimated to be 70 kb (Table 1).

#### Analysis of variance showed significant differences in aggressiveness 
among the 28 Cmn strains (P < 0.0001). Disease severity (proportion 
of the leaf area affected) ranged from 16.0 to 78%. Strain NE4 was the most aggressive while GIL 1 was the least aggressive on the maize hybrid DKC55-09 (Fig 2).

**Figure 2: Mean aggressiveness (n = 12 plants) of 28 Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis strains estimated from foliar blight severity on maize hybrid DKC 55–09.** Plants were inoculated at the V3–V4 crop developmental stage and foliar blight severity was rated as the 
proportion of leaf area affected six days after inoculation. Bars represent standard errors of the mean. *Strain 91-R was included as a reference for pathogenicity in this experiment.

### **Comparative sequence analyses of putative virulence genes**:
#### Thirty-three genes that encode for putative virulence factors identified in the Cmn genome database were successfully amplified and sequenced for Cmn strain GIL1 (pathogenic) and Cmn strain HF4 (non-pathogenic on maize).

#### GIL1 had identical gene sequences with the reference Cmn strain [[NCPPB2581]]

#### When the GIL1 gene sequences were compared to those of HF4, polymorphisms were detected in the Cellulase A, two endoglucanase genes, the xylanase B gene, and the pectate lyase gene

#### To further characterize the nucleotide differences we observed in the [[celB]] and endogluconase (Cmn 2651) genes, we sequenced each loci in five additional Cmn strains (FN, C4, NE3, GIL3, and 91-R) and a non-pathogenic Clavibacter michiganensis strain (NE1).

#### The avirulent strain NE1 and the virulent strains NE3, FN, GIL3, and 91-R were similar and lacked the 18 nucleotide insertion, while the virulent strains C4 and the avirulent strain HF4 contained the 18 nucleotide insertion

## **Discussion**:
### Toxicity genes have been hypothesized to play a role in virulence of Cmn, but only one of twelve putative toxin genes in the genome of Cmn has been partially characterized.

### This membrane-active component called the chloride anion channel (CAC) protein was shown to form anion channels in planar lipid bilayers in vitro.

### The activity of this protein was shown to be similar to that of both colicins and the Hm-T toxins. However, its direct role in pathogenicity on maize was not demonstrated [26, 27, 35,36].

### Moreover, we found no sequence polymorphism within the CAC gene in both pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains. Similarly, there was no relationship between sequence polymorphisms observed in four putative virulence genes and the ability of the strains to be pathogenic on maize.

## Other notes:
### The remaining twenty-seven strains were recovered from washes of leaves harvested in 2012 and 2013 from apparently healthy corn plants grown in minimally tilled fields with a history of Goss’s disease in the previous growing season in Iowa (6 fields) and Nebraska (1 field).
