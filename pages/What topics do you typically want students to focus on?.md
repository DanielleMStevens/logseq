title: What topics do you typically want students to focus on?
---

- Think about the methods/tools you want to use, what information can they gain you, what flaws they may have
- Be willing to draw out a pipeline (for example assemble and/or annotation) and why I used the tools I do (i.e. Guppy over Albacore)
	- What are the strangths of Nanopore over Pacbio
	- Think about the questions that might be asked in the context of my project and how I could illustrate my answer
- In the context of [[Transmission genetics]]
	- understanding basic [[Mendelian genetics]]
	- understanding [[Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium]] and it's implication
	- Essentially understand at a BIS101 level.
- In the context of my project:
	- understanding the functional roles of [[accessory genes]]
	- the role of [[Horizontal Gene Transfer]] and how to differentiate that from [[gene loss/gain]] events and how we can infer this from [[phylogenetics]]
	- how [[conjugative elements]] move
	- how [[phage]] can undergo [[quorum sensing ]]
- Other topics:
	- How [[epistasis]] in [[sexual systems]] can lead to a distortion in expression
		- If expression switches from cis to trans
		- Think in the context of systems such as [[hybrid necrosis]] and [[R-gene incompatibility]]
- Papers/systems to look into:
	- The marine bacterium clorococcus (not sure how to spell)
	- [[Alex Greenlon]]'s paper on Global-level [[population genomics]] in [[PNAS]]
