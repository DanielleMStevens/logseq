- **Abstract**:
	- [[vatr1]] and [[vatr2]] belong to TetR and MocR families of transcriptional regulators, respectively
	- both mutants grew well in vitro and reached a high titer in planta, they caused reduced wilting and canker development in infected plants compared with the wild-type bacterium
	- expression of virulence factors, membrane and secreted proteins, and signal-transducing proteins.
- **Introduction**:
	- [[Clavibacter michiganensis]] can also colonize the fruit and seed, and infected seed are a major source of disease spreading (Fatmi et al. 1991; Tsiantos 1987).
	- A second family is the chymotrypsin-related Ppa family of serine 
	  proteases, which includes 11 members, and the third is the 3-member 
	  family of subtilase proteases.
	- Among these, [[chpC]], [[ppaA]], and [[ppaC]] were shown to have an effect on C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis virulence or colonization-ability
	- molecular pathways leading to pathogenicity are unknown
	- In a previous proteomic study, we showed that [[Clavibacter michiganensis]] specifically triggers activation of the host [ACC-oxidase (ACO)]([[Ethylene Biosynthesis]]), the last enzyme in the ethylene biosynthesis pathway, leading to increased ethylene production and symptom development [(Savidor et al. 2012)]([[The Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis-Tomato Interactome Reveals the Perception of Pathogen by the Host and Suggests Mechanisms of Infection]]).
	- Same study showed tomato plants activate basal defense responses, although partial, with some suppressed components
- **Results**:
	- **Mutations in the vatr1 and vatr2 genes cause reduced disease symptoms**:
		- both proteins are putative transcriptional regulators containing DNA binding motifs, where Vatr1 is a protein belonging to the TetR family of transcriptional repressors and Vatr2 is a member of the GntR family of transcriptional regulators
		- PCR analysis of the pCM2 encoded pat-1 gene demonstrated that both mutants maintained the native pCM2 plasmid, which is sometimes lost during transformation (data not shown).

		  **Fig. 1. Mutants Δvatr1 and Δvatr2 cause reduced disease symptoms in  infected plants.** Five-week-old tomato plants were inoculated with wild-type Cmm382, Δvatr1, or Δvatr2. A, Plants were monitored for wilting of the first leaf at different days post inoculation (dpi). For plants infected with wild-type Cmm382 and Δvatr1, the experiment was stopped when plants reached 100% wilting (dotted line). B, Typical wilting in infected tomato plants at 10 dpi. The red arrow in the Δvatr1 panel points to a wilted leaf among others that had not yet wilted. C, Canker size of infected plants at 15 dpi. Bars represent average and standard deviation (n = 15). An asterisk (*) represents a statistically significant difference between the mutant and the wild type according to a t test with P value < 0.05. D, Typical canker in infected tomato 
		  stems at 15 dpi. Experiments were repeated three times with similar results.
	- **Growth of Δvatr1 and Δvatr2 mutants in vitro and in planta**:
		- To exclude the possibility that Vatr1 and Vatr2 are involved in house-keeping processes that are essential for normal growth and development of the bacterium, grown in vitro in rich medium
		- Both mutants grew at the same rate as the wild type

		  **Fig. 3. In vitro and in planta growth of Δvatr1 and Δvatr2 mutants**: Twenty milliliters of A, Luria-Bertani (LB) medium or B, infection-mimicking medium were inoculated with Cmm382, Δvatr1, or Δvatr2 to an initial optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.02 or 0.2, respectively, and culture density was monitored for 30 h postinoculation (hpi). Error bars represent the standarderror (n = 3). C, Five-week-old tomato plants were inoculated with Cmm382, Δvatr1, or Δvatr2. At 4, 7, 13, and 15 days postinoculation (dpi), a 0.5-cm stem section was cut at 1 cm above the inoculation site. Stem sections were weighted, homogenized, serially diluted, and plated on LB agar, and CFU were calculated. Error bars represent the standard error (n = 3). Asterisks (*) represent statistically significant differences between mutants and wild type at the indicated time points according to a t test with P value < 0.05. Experiments were repeated three times with similar results.
		- Although the Δvatr1 mutant showed similar bacterial titer over the course of infection as Cmm382, the titer of Δvatr2 was reduced approximately fivefold compared with Cmm382. Still, even this reduction in the ability of Δvatr2 to grow in planta is not sufficient by itself to explain the dramatic attenuation in virulence of the mutant, because Δvatr2 still reached a very high bacterial titer ($$5 x 10^9$$ CFU/g of tissue)

		  **Fig. 2. Complementation of vatr1 and vatr2 in their respective mutants restores virulence.** Twenty-four 5-week-old tomato plants were inoculated
		   with Cmm101 wild-type (cured of pCM2), Δvatr1 (cured of pCM2), Δvatr2 (cured of pCM2), vatr1 complemented strain (cured of pCM2), or vatr2 complemented strain (cured of pCM2) and were monitored for wilting of the first leaf at different days postinoculation (dpi). The experiment was stopped when plants reached 100% wilting (dotted line). The experiment was repeated three times with similar results.
	- **Mutants Δvatr1 and Δvatr2 reduce ethylene production in infected plants**:
		- Δvatr1 and Δvatr2 cause reduced ethylene production in infected plants
		- To test whether the reduced ethylene production in the mutant-inoculated plants is correlated with ACO levels, Western blotting of protein extracts from stem pieces of inoculated plants was performed using α:ACO antibodies. Similar to ethylene levels, ACO levels of Δvatr2-inoculated plants were drastically below those of Cmm382-inoculated plants, whereas Δvatr1-inoculated plants showed a more moderate reduction (Fig. 4B).

		  **Fig. 4. Mutants Δvatr1 and Δvatr2 cause reduced ethylene emission from 
		  inoculated tomato stems**: Five-week-old tomato plants were inoculated with wild-type Cmm382, Δvatr1, Δvatr2, or sterile water (mock-inoculated). A, Ethylene emission from stems of infected plants measured at 15 days post inoculation (dpi) by gas chromatography. Three biological replicates were performed and the ratio of emitted ethylene between plants infected with wild-type or mutant bacteria and mock-inoculated plants was calculated. Asterisks (*) represent statistically significant differences between mutants and wild type according to a t test with P value < 0.05. B, Western blot analysis of total proteins that were extracted from stems at 8 dpi, using 
		  antibodies raised against ACC-oxidase (α:ACO) or actin (α:actin), as reference.
	- **Bioinformatic analysis of Vatr1 and Vatr2**:
		- transcriptional repressors that control genes whose products are involved in different cellular processes, including different catabolic pathways, antibiotics biosynthesis, and pathogenicity
		- Downstream of [[vatr1]], encodes two DNA helicases, a phospholipase, a NUDIX hydrolase, and a hypothetical protein. Thus, a direct link to virulence is not immediately evident from the location of vatr1 in the genome.
		- GntR proteins are either repressors or activators of transcription, regulating a wide variety of biological processes
		- MocR subfamily of GntR proteins. Members of this subfamily contain a C-terminal domain of approximately 350 residues homologous to class I aminotransferase proteins, which are enzymes that catalyze the reversible transfer of an amino group from the amino acid substrate to an acceptor α-keto acid, and require pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) as a cofactor for this reaction
		- The vatr2 gene is genomically located directly downstream of the two thioredoxins genes trxB1 (CMM_2967)  and trxA (CMM_2968).
		- Thioredoxins are small redox proteins that reduce different molecules. Thus, in planta, TrxA and TrxB1 may reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are produced as a part of the tomato defense response
	- **Identification of molecular pathways affected by Vatr1 and Vatr2**:
		- quantitative (q)PCR. The expression of pat-1 and vatr1 was highest at 180 min post-transfer to IMM, whereas expression of vatr2 did not significantly change after transfer to IMM along the timeline, and even slightly decreased (Fig. 5).
		- Total RNA was extracted from all samples and was used for RNA-seq 
		  analysis. Expression profiles for each strain were quantitatively compared between LB and IMM to identify differentially expressed genes between treatments.
		- If a transcriptional regulator is virulence specific, the genes that are positively regulated by it are expected to be upregulated in IMM in the wild-type Cmm382.
		- expression of these target genes is not expected to change (or the magnitude of change is expected to be significantly lower, if other factors cumulatively contribute to the regulation)
		- The operon including the four genes CMM_0328 to CMM_0331, which encodes genes responsible for the biosynthesis of a siderophore homologous to the biosynthetic genes of the Yersinia virulence factor Yersiniabactin (Ybt), is also commonly regulated by Vatr1 and Vatr2
		- Other genes positively regulated by Vatr1 and Vatr2 encode the chaperones ClpY and GroEL, the heat-shock protein CMM_2092, several membrane proteins, proteins involved in metabolism, a catalase involved in ROS scavenging, and several hypothetical proteins with unknown function.
		- Interestingly, of the 40 genes negatively regulated by Vatr1 and Vatr2, most genes (23 genes) encode either membrane or secreted proteins.
		- hydrolytic enzymes, an acetyltransferase, an esterase, a sugar transporter, and several proteins of unknown function.
		- Because multiple genes were regulated by Vatr1 and Vatr2, the promoter regions of these regulated genes were searched for enriched sequence motifs that may indicate a common binding site for their transcriptional regulators. This analysis revealed three and seven such potential binding motifs in genes regulated by Vatr1 and Vatr2, respectively

		  **Fig. 7. Proposed model for Clavibacter michiganensis pathogenicity**: Upon invasion, C. michiganensis senses the plant environment and transduces a signal for activation of a virulence pathway. Induction of the virulence pathway leads to transcriptional activation of vatr1 and vatr2 as well as to  increased stability of the Vatr2 protein. Vatr1 and Vatr2 regulate downstream genes in the pathway, either directly by binding their regulatory DNA region or indirectly by affecting other transcriptional regulators that regulate them. Vatr1 and Vatr2 are found on separate branches of the virulence pathway that converge at Vatr2 and, possibly, elsewhere in the pathway. Upstream of their convergence in the pathway, expression of genes coding for secreted and membrane proteins, which may be recognized by the plant as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and induce a defense response, is downregulated. Nonetheless, downstream of the convergence in the pathway, genes involved in virulence, including several virulence factors, are upregulated. As a result, C. michiganensis overcomes the plant defense response, hydrolyzes and degrades the plant tissue, and upregulates tomato ACC-oxidase and ethylene biosynthesis, thus resulting in stem canker and leaf wilting.
- **Discussion**:
	- TetR family have not only been shown to be DNA-binding transcriptional repressors but also were also implicated in regulating virulence.
	- HapR from Vibrio cholerae has been shown to be a transcriptional 
	  regulator with a central role in control of virulence, in a cell-density-dependent way
	- known and putative virulence factors, is regulated by Vatr1 or Vatr2, either directly or indirectly.
