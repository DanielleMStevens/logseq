- **Abstract:**
	- directed insertion of gene constructs in a permissive chromosomal site of the bacterial wilt pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum
	- collection of suicide vectors—the Ralstonia chromosome (pRC) series—that carry an integration element flanked by transcription terminators and two sequences of homology to the chromosome of strain GMI1000, where the integration element is inserted through a double recombination even
	- the system can be readily used in GMI1000 and adapted to other R. solanacearum strains using an accessory plasmid.
	- the system has been used to purify and study secretion type III effectors
- **Introduction:**
	- the eps promoter (Pep) driving transcription of the operon for exopolysaccharide synthesis is controlled by a cell-density-dependent regulator
	- Genome sequencing has revealed an enormous number of genes whose role is unknown.
	- marked the start of genome-wide approaches to unravel its interaction, specificity, and adaptation toward the plant hos
