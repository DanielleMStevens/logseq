- **Abstract:**
	- directed insertion of gene constructs in a permissive chromosomal site of the bacterial wilt pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum
	- collection of suicide vectors—the Ralstonia chromosome (pRC) series—that carry an integration element flanked by transcription terminators and two sequences of homology to the chromosome of strain GMI1000, where the integration element is inserted through a double recombination even
	- the system can be readily used in GMI1000 and adapted to other R. solanacearum strains using an accessory plasmid.
	- the system has been used to purify and study secretion type III effectors
- **Introduction:**
	- the eps promoter (Pep) driving transcription of the operon for exopolysaccharide synthesis is controlled by a cell-density-dependent regulator
	- Genome sequencing has revealed an enormous number of genes whose role is unknown.
	- marked the start of genome-wide approaches to unravel its interaction, specificity, and adaptation toward the plant host
	- However, the study of gene function in R. solanacearum has been somewhat limited by the lack of stable expression systems.
		- The RP4-derived pLAFR plasmids (Staskawicz et al. 1987) have been very useful for gene overexpression but they have major drawbacks for their use in high-scale postgenomics studies: they lack a versatile polylinker, selection is restricted to tetracycline, and they show low stability under competitive conditions (e.g., plant infection).
		- IncQ plasmids (Kawasaki et al. 2007b) or plasmids based on the RSF1010 (M. Valls, unpublished) or the pVS1 replicon (S. Cunnac, personal communication) have both proven unstable in R. solanacearum, even in the presence of antibiotic resistance, strongly limiting the substitutes to the pLAFR series.
		- An alternative could be the recently described vectors derived from phage phiRSS1 (Kawasaki et al. 2007a,b) or pUFJ10 (Gabriel et al. 2006). These vectors were almost perfectly maintained in R. solanacearum without selective pressure but they are very limited in terms of cloning sites or antibiotic resistance.
	- These tools are based on a versatile genetic element where any promoter::ORF (open reading frame) combination can be cloned and stably integrated in a permissive site of the bacterial chromosome
- **Results:**
	- **Construction of a set of modular vectors for gene integration in the chromosome of R. solanacearum GMI1000.**
		- In order to stably transform R. solanacearum GMI1000, we selected as a target site nucleotide position 203,337, located in one of the longest intergenic regions in the chromosome (Fig. 1C)
		- We hypothesized that this was a permissive site because it is devoid of predicted ORF and lies downstream of surrounding genes (one of which is a predicted pseudogene), suggest-ing that it does not contain a promoter region either.
		- The vectors contain approximately 1 Kb of the chromosomal DNA sequences immediately upstream and downstream of the target site flanking the element to be integrated.
		- we included an antibiotic resistance gene for selection of insertions, multiple restriction sites, and a GATEWAY cassette to facilitate the directional cloning of any promoter::gene combination (Figure 1A)
		- To avoid read-through to and from neighboring chromosomal regions, once integrated, transcriptional terminators were also cloned at both sides of the inserted element (Figure 1)
		- pRCG, pRCT, and pRCK, containing a gentamicin, tetracycline, or kanamycin
	- **The pRC vectors stably deliver insertion elements into the chromosome of R. solanacearum GMI1000.**
		- The pRC vectors stably deliver insertion elements into the chromosome of R. solanacearum GMI1000.
		- Correct integration of constructs in the target region between ORF RSc0178 and RSc0179 was verified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of genomic DNA with pairs of specific primers, one annealing to the inserted element and the other to a genomic region outside the recombination regions
		- To verify the genetic stability of the insertions in the absence of antibiotic selection,
