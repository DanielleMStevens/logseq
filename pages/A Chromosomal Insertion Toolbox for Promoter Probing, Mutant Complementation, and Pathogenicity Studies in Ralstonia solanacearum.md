- **Abstract:**
	- directed insertion of gene constructs in a permissive chromosomal site of the bacterial wilt pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum
	- collection of suicide vectors—the Ralstonia chromosome (pRC) series—that carry an integration element flanked by transcription terminators and two sequences of homology to the chromosome of strain GMI1000, where the integration element is inserted through a double recombination even
	- the system can be readily used in GMI1000 and adapted to other R. solanacearum strains using an accessory plasmid.
	- the system has been used to purify and study secretion type III effectors
- **Introduction:**
	- the eps promoter (Pep) driving transcription of the operon for exopolysaccharide synthesis is controlled by a cell-density-dependent regulator
	- Genome sequencing has revealed an enormous number of genes whose role is unknown.
	- marked the start of genome-wide approaches to unravel its interaction, specificity, and adaptation toward the plant host
	- However, the study of gene function in R. solanacearum has been somewhat limited by the lack of stable expression systems.
		- The RP4-derived pLAFR plasmids (Staskawicz et al. 1987) have been very useful for gene overexpression but they have major drawbacks for their use in high-scale postgenomics studies: they lack a versatile polylinker, selection is restricted to tetracycline, and they show low stability under competitive conditions (e.g., plant infection).
		- IncQ plasmids (Kawasaki et al. 2007b) or plasmids based on the RSF1010 (M. Valls, unpublished) or the pVS1 replicon (S. Cunnac, personal communication) have both proven unstable in R. solanacearum, even in the presence of antibiotic resistance, strongly limiting the substitutes to the pLAFR series.
		- An alternative could be the recently described vectors derived from phage phiRSS1 (Kawasaki et al. 2007a,b) or pUFJ10 (Gabriel et al. 2006). These vectors were almost perfectly maintained in R. solanacearum without selective pressure but they are very limited in terms of cloning sites or antibiotic resistance.
	- These tools are based on a versatile genetic element where any promoter::ORF (open reading frame) combination can be cloned and stably integrated in a permissive site of the bacterial chromosome
- **Results:**
	- **Construction of a set of modular vectors for gene integration in the chromosome of R. solanacearum GMI1000.**
		- In order to stably transform R. solanacearum GMI1000, we selected as a target site nucleotide position 203,337, located in one of the longest intergenic regions in the chromosome (Fig. 1C)
		- We hypothesized that this was a permissive site because it is devoid of predicted ORF and lies downstream of surrounding genes (one of which is a predicted pseudogene), suggest-ing that it does not contain a promoter region either.
		- The vectors contain approximately 1 Kb of the chromosomal DNA sequences immediately upstream and downstream of the target site flanking the element to be integrated.
		- we included an antibiotic resistance gene for selection of insertions, multiple restriction sites, and a GATEWAY cassette to facilitate the directional cloning of any promoter::gene combination (Figure 1A)
		- To avoid read-through to and from neighboring chromosomal regions, once integrated, transcriptional terminators were also cloned at both sides of the inserted element (Figure 1)
		- pRCG, pRCT, and pRCK, containing a gentamicin, tetracycline, or kanamycin
	- **The pRC vectors stably deliver insertion elements into the chromosome of R. solanacearum GMI1000.**
		- The pRC vectors stably deliver insertion elements into the chromosome of R. solanacearum GMI1000.
		- Correct integration of constructs in the target region between ORF RSc0178 and RSc0179 was verified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of genomic DNA with pairs of specific primers, one annealing to the inserted element and the other to a genomic region outside the recombination regions
		- To verify the genetic stability of the insertions in the absence of antibiotic selection,
		- Almost all bacteria recovered from wilting plants maintained the tetracycline resistance borne in the integration element, which was maintained without selective pressure. In contrast, the pLAFR3 plasmid was readily lost, as detected by the high proportion of tetracycline-sensitive bacteria recovered
	- **The pRC system can be used for gene integration in other R. solanacearum strains.**
		- Because the sequences surrounding the permissive chromosomal integration site are not conserved in all isolates of R. solanacearum , we devised a system to render our integration toolbox compatible with the whole species
		- which enabled the introduction of the GMI1000 homology regions targeted pRCs into phylotype IIA strains
		- A tetracycline resistance marker was cloned between the GMI1000 regions for negative selection of integration events in the recipient strain
		- First, we identified ORF RSc0178 in UW551 and cloned outside of the GMI1000 target regions two 1-kb-long fragments lying downstream of the gene.
		- The resulting tetracycline-resistant transformants contained the GMI1000 homology sequences in the permissive site downstream of glmS and could now receive any DNA ele- ment for integration carried by pRC suicide plasmids.
	- **Integration of insertion elements into the chromosome of R. solanacearum does not affect viability or pathogenicity.**
		- We subsequently checked the effect on viability of the integrations using GMI1000 strains carrying two representative gentamicin-resistant elements with fusions of the strong eps promoter to the GFP or LacZ genes
		- The GMI1000 strain or the strain containing a gentamicin-resistant integration element with the LacZ reporter gene
		- gene insertion in the tar- get chromosomal region did not alter the viability or fitness of the bacterium in planta
	- **Addition of a single copy of hrpG can complement a deletion mutant for this gene.**
		- The results (Fig. 3B) indicate that a single copy of the gene integrated in the permissive region was sufficient to fully restore the plant HR response toward the bacterium, proving the utility of the system for gene complementation in competitive conditions such as growth in planta.
	- **pRCs are a useful tool for bacterial promoter probing in culture or in planta.**
		- The integration of genetic elements into a position of the R. solanacearum genome can be used to test activity of any promoter::reporter fusion under the natural stoichiometry (i.e., in monocopy) and in the same genomic environment.
		- The low background expression of the double mutant and that of a strain devoid of any promoter up-stream of lacZ (data not shown) proved that the transcriptional terminators flanking the insertion element were actively avoid-ing read-through from neighboring promoters in the genome
		- For this, we used the noninvasive GFP reporter, better suited for in vivo studies, because it does not require addition of any substrate.
