- Meeting with [[Doug Cook]] regarding [[QE Exam]]
	- Questions:
		- [[What topics do you typically want students to focus on?]]
			- In the context of [[Transmission genetics]]
				- understanding basic [[Mendelian genetics]]
				- understanding [[Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium]] and it's implication
				- Essentially understand at a BIS101 level.
			- In the context of my project:
				- understanding the functional roles of [[accessory genes]]
				- the role of [[Horizontal Gene Transfer]] and how to differentiate that from [[gene loss/gain]] events and how we can infer this from [[phylogenetics]]
				- how [[conjugative elements]] move
				- how [[phage]] can undergo [[quorum sensing ]]
			- Other topics:
				- How [[epistasis]] in [[sexual systems]] can lead to a distortion in expression
					- If expression switches from cis to trans
					- Think in the context of systems such as [[hybrid necrosis]] and [[R-gene incompatibility]]
			- Papers/systems to look into:
				- The marine bacterium clorococcus (not sure how to spell)
				- [[Alex Greenlon]]'s paper on Global-level [[population genomics]] in [[PNAS]]
				- Mircoscale recombination
		- [[Do you think students struggle with most?]]
			- Understanding topics both broadly and deeply
- Worked on [[QE Exam]]
	- In Annual Review Paper on [[Gram-Positive, plant-associated Bacteria]] called [[The Evolution, Ecology, and Mechanisms of Infection by Gram-Positive, plant-associated Bacteria]], we state that [[Rhodococcus]] has encoded [[canidate elicitors]]
		- Under current models, populations under conflict are predicted to be rapidly [[diversifying selection]]. [[Gram-negative pathogens]] present evidence for [[diversifying selection]] acting on regions of [[candidate elicitors]] of [[plant immunity]]
		- we focused on those in which there was evidence for [[positive selection]] acting on clusters of two or more sites within a window of 30 codons.
		- but these candidates will need to be experimentally tested.
