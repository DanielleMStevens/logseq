## To calculate ::[[read depth]]
### $$D = LN/G$$
L: read length, N: # of reads, G: genome size 

## **To calculate** [[N50]]
### Minimum contig length required to cover 50% of the genome

## Understanding Basic ::[[Population Genetics]]
### [[pi]]: mean pairwise differencesroam 

### [[theta]]: # of segregating sites

### [[Tajima's D]]: is computed as the difference between two measures of genetic diversity: the mean number of pairwise differences and the number of segregating sites, ^^each scaled^^ so that they are expected to ^^be the same in a neutrally evolving population of constant size^^ 
#### D=0 neutral
D>0 balancing
D<0 positive

## How does [[5FC]] at as a counter selectent?
