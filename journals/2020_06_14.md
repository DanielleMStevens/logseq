- Notes from my [[QE Exam]]:
	- From [[Doug Cook]]:
		- Hi Dani, Good job today. Here is the manuscript I  mentioned on lateral transduction, which is a phage-mediated HGT phenomenon. Then two additional manuscripts about quorum sensing among phage. The may or may not be relevant as you pursue your work, but should be interesting in any case. Doug

	- From [[Dan Kliebenstein]]:
		- Hey,  Nice job on the QE. It’s a cool project and looking forward to the results. Here are the things we were both puzzled by to check on.
			- Are the [[sax loci]] in [[Pseudomonas syringae]] secreted?
			- How many aromatic degrading genes are in CAzymes as that is a carbohydrate database and not aromatic metabolism genes?
			- [[Tajima's D]], do every single gene and then take the distribution.
			- Lateral transduction methodology using phage in Gram+ comment from Doug.
- Read paper for [[journal club]] called [[Chitin perception in plasmodesmata characterizes submembrane immune-signaling specificity in plants]]
- TODO [[June 1th, 2020]] read [[Unexpected conservation and global transmission of agrobacterial virulence plasmids]]
- TODO [[June 19th, 2020]] read [[__Pseudomonas sax__ Genes Overcome Aliphatic Isothiocyanate–Mediated Non-Host Resistance in __Arabidopsis__]]
- Conversations with [[Michael S. Belcher]] on [[June 3rd, 2020]]
	- Here are the emails for the experts at JBEI on all things cell wall.
	- Aymerick Eudes (Lignin expert, but also whole cell wall): [ageudes@lbl.gov](mailto:ageudes@lbl.gov)
	- Jenny Mortimer: [jcmortimer@lbl.gov](mailto:jcmortimer@lbl.gov)
	- Henrik Scheller: [hscheller@lbl.gov](mailto:hscheller@lbl.gov)
	- This week has been extremely hectic for all the directors though, so they may not respond right away, but they also may get right back to you haha. If you have questions for your QE hit them up right away, otherwise I can send an introductory email for you to all of them early next week. Wouldn't be the best time to do it right now.
