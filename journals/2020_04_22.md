## Meeting with [[Titus Brown]] regarding [[QE Exam]]
### Questions:
#### [[What topics do you typically want students to focus on?]]
##### Think about the methods/tools you want to use, what information can they gain you, what flaws they may have

##### Be willing to draw out a pipeline (for example assemble and/or annotation) and why I used the tools I do (i.e. Guppy over Albacore)
###### What are the strengths of Nanopore over Pacbio

###### Think about the questions that might be asked in the context of my project and how I could illustrate my answer

#### [[Do you think students struggle with most?]]
##### making sure you take a step back in your project to be able to communicate it with a  broad audience.
